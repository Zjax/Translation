1
00:00:00,432 --> 00:00:03,661
MATT: And welcome to tonight's episode of Critical
Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:05,641
sit around and play Dungeons & Dragons.

3
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:08,257
TRAVIS: Dungeons & Dragons!

4
00:00:08,257 --> 00:00:10,736
MATT: Or that. We also do that, I guess.

5
00:00:10,736 --> 00:00:13,641
TALIESIN: That's the same embarrassment that you
feel about us; the way we're feeling about you now.

6
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:15,810
MATT: What the fuck was that?!

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,957
SAM: Where we play Dungeons & Dragons!

8
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:25,792
MATT: Oh my god. Welcome. We're already loopy,
what could possibly go wrong? So yes, welcome!

9
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,846
Before we jump into tonight's game, we have some
announcements to get through real fast so hold

10
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:33,484
tight for just a moment. First and foremost,
continuing tonight's sponsorship with our friends

11
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:41,054
at D&D Beyond. Our now long-term partner. We're
super excited to be working with them for the

12
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:44,456
foreseeable future for the time being with the
show. Sam, you have some words, I believe.

13
00:00:44,456 --> 00:00:49,426
SAM: To plug our good friends at D&D Beyond, I
need my fellow castmates to help me. Can we

14
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:51,469
practice? Can you all say, "Boo"?

15
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:53,046
ALL: Boo!

16
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:54,429
SAM: Can you all say, "Yay"?

17
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,787
ALL: Yay!

18
00:00:55,787 --> 00:01:00,198
SAM: Okay, the official digital toolset for
Critical Role is D&D Beyond.

19
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:01,755
ALL: Yay!

20
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:06,376
SAM: A great service to organize everything D&D.
Rules, spells, character sheets, and more, all

21
00:01:06,376 --> 00:01:08,177
with a pesky pen and paper?

22
00:01:08,177 --> 00:01:10,194
ALL: Boo!

23
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:14,846
SAM: No! You can access it digitally on your
computer, mobile, or tablet.

24
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:16,796
ALL: Yay!

25
00:01:16,796 --> 00:01:21,483
SAM: The cast is using D&D Beyond every week,
except for Taliesin.

26
00:01:21,483 --> 00:01:23,206
ALL: Boo!

27
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:24,707
SAM: Just kidding, he is!

28
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:26,427
ALL: Yay!

29
00:01:26,427 --> 00:01:34,582
SAM: I have to use both the boo and the yay or
else it doesn't make sense. He can do cool stuff

30
00:01:34,582 --> 00:01:39,200
like activate Critical Role content in his
character builder and create a blood hunter.

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,739
ALL: Yay!

32
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:43,197
SAM: And do you think they charge an arm and a
leg?

33
00:01:43,197 --> 00:01:45,134
ALL: Boo!

34
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:47,518
SAM: No, they don't!

35
00:01:47,518 --> 00:01:49,820
ALL: Yay!

36
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,850
SAM: D&D Beyond is offering a discount of $10 off
any digital book in their shop. Use code

37
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,016

00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,609
ALL: Yay!

39
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:02,733
SAM: So check them out at dndbeyond.com. Is that D

40
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:04,034
ALL: Boo!

41
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:07,084
SAM: No, is that D-N-D Beyond?

42
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:08,397
ALL: Yay!

43
00:02:08,397 --> 00:02:10,650
SAM: And this spot was written by Sam Riegel.

44
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,000
ALL: Boo!

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,731
(laughter)

46
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:21,879
MATT: Thank you so much, Sam. And thank you, D&D
Beyond, for being our partners for this new

47
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,306
campaign.

48
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:25,437
LAURA: Marisha, you yay'ed, good for you!

49
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:30,866
MARISHA: I did! It was a little complacent, but I
yay'ed. I gave him one.

50
00:02:30,866 --> 00:02:40,931
MATT: Oh man. Talks Machina, of course, our after
talk show about this episode will be on next

51
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:46,205
Tuesday, as it is every Tuesday, after the show at
7:00pm Pacific here on Twitch and Project Alpha,

52
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:50,018
with our host Brian W. Foster. (burp) I always
burp when I say his name. I wonder what that says

53
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:52,019
about him. I don't know why.

54
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,912
LAURA: It's that cabbage smell.

55
00:02:53,912 --> 00:02:57,919
MATT: It's the cabbage. So check that out. Merch,
Laura.

56
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:04,949
LAURA: So, you know, we talked about those posters
last week. They're still in the store on

57
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:12,080
pre-order. Some of them are getting shipped out
right now, so you should be getting them soon.

58
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,096
ALL: Yay!

59
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:18,562
LAURA: We're going to leave them on pre-order
until Monday night, so if you're watching this on

60
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:23,472
YouTube after it's been aired live, you've got until
midnight to put in that order.

61
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:25,248
ALL: Yay.

62
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:29,352
LAURA: Then they're going to be gone. Well, we
might have a small overage that remains in the

63
00:03:29,352 --> 00:03:34,546
store. But the pre-orders will be done. You know
what I mean. And then hey, check out that other

64
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:42,657
stuff like shirts, hats, and dice. We should be
getting some more Vox Machina d20s. I know a lot

65
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:46,461
of people have been asking about them. They're
going to be restocked, hopefully within the next week.

66
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:49,969
More will be coming soon if those sell out. You
know how it goes.

67
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:59,510
MATT: Great, thank you, Laura. Podcast. Episode
one of this campaign is already up. So those of

68
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,592
you following in podcast form or have friends who
have been waiting to listen to the podcast on

69
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:09,020
their commute; it is available, the first episode.
Every Thursday morning, we'll have the episode of

70
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,556
the previous week available and we'll be keeping
those up consistently as the campaign progresses,

71
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:18,874
and we also have the entire story of Vox Machina
currently available on podcast. Makes me happy.

72
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:27,065
Once again, we are firmly in support of our
longtime charity partners, 826LA. They do awesome

73
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:31,742
work teaching creative writing classes for
children who normally wouldn't have the

74
00:04:31,742 --> 00:04:37,557
opportunity to get involved. They do phenomenal
work. I recommend that you research them and if

75
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:42,687
you can, either help with a donation or actually,
you can donate your time as well to help teach and

76
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:45,569
be part of the program if one is near you. Go
check it out.

77
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:51,370
MARISHA: We were talking to one of the heads at
826LA over the break, Joel, and he was saying that

78
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:59,038
they would love to do D&D, but no one on their
staff knows how to DM or do D&D. So if there's an

79
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:03,916
826 in your area, and you're like, "I know, I'll
start a D&D club," I'm sure they'll be open to it,

80
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,951
just go talk to them and go teach kids D&D!

81
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:11,163
MATT: Yeah. Run a game for a bunch of cool
teenagers and show them how awesome this game is.

82
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:14,091
MARISHA: Or cool eight-year-olds who are equally
as amazing.

83
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:16,675
SAM: Or dorky eight-year-olds or teenagers.

84
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:18,579
MATT: Those are the same, Sam.

85
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:20,495
MARISHA: Nerd is chic now.

86
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:27,572
MATT: I like to think I was always cool. No, it's
not true at all. I'm still trying to get there.

87
00:05:27,572 --> 00:05:33,690
All right, cool! Appearances. Laura and Travis
will be at Emerald City Comic Con in Seattle,

88
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,680
March 2nd to the 4th. If you're up in that area,
go over and say hi to them. I will be at Lexington

89
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:45,495
Comic and Toy Con in Lexington, Kentucky March 9th
to the 11th. As well as Otafest in Calgary up in

90
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:50,091
Canada, May 18th to the 20th, and Akon in Texas,
June 7th to the 10th.

91
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:53,528
SAM: Calgary is like the Kentucky of Canada.

92
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:55,060
LAURA: Is it?

93
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,583
SAM: I don't know.

94
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,791
MARISHA: I'll take that as a compliment.

95
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:05,814
LIAM: I am also going to Bak-Anime, not to be
confused with SacAnime, on February 3rd and 4th.

96
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:07,646
TRAVIS: How do you spell that, B-A-K?

97
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:09,966
LIAM: B-A-K, that's real soon. So I'll be there.

98
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:13,824
MATT: Beautiful. And I believe--

99
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:20,583
LIAM: Wait! Comic book next week. Issue four.
Comic book.

100
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:23,689
MATT: Issue four on the 24th, I believe it is?

101
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:29,053
TALIESIN: By far the most fourth of all of these
books. It's easily the most fourth.

102
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:31,536
TRAVIS: Like the blue hair.

103
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:35,302
TALIESIN: Thank you, this is new. Just went for
this, it's going to slowly darken over time.

104
00:06:35,302 --> 00:06:37,524
MATT: Into pure shadow.

105
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:43,201
TALIESIN: It's going to be keyframed and
photoshopped, I'm aware.

106
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:47,161
MATT: The invitation is there, folks. Screencap and
photoshop away.

107
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:50,011
TALIESIN: I've already been told that's it's going
to happen.

108
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:56,901
MATT: On that note, that concludes our
announcements, thank you for your patience. And I

109
00:06:56,901 --> 00:07:04,322
believe it's time for us to begin tonight's
episode of Critical Role.

110
00:07:04,322 --> 00:08:26,103
[80s music]

111
00:08:26,103 --> 00:08:35,740
MATT: And welcome back. Last we left off, our
slowly gathering band of adventurers had begun to

112
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,666
have their stories intertwine in the city of
Trostenwald, on the southern reaches of western

113
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:46,905
Wynandir on the continent of Wildemount. Here we
had Nott and Caleb who had been traveling

114
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:53,159
southward coming and meeting, in the center of the
tavern, the Nestled Nook Inn, with Jester,

115
00:08:53,159 --> 00:09:01,857
Beauregard, and Fjord. They were invited to a
nearby carnival that had begun preparing for their

116
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:09,368
performance later that evening, in which they met
Yasha and Molly. After swapping some stories,

117
00:09:09,368 --> 00:09:17,177
earning and losing some gold, they began to gather
at the outskirts of the Ustaloch, the lake right

118
00:09:17,177 --> 00:09:22,673
on the eastern edge of Trostenwald, for the first
opening performance of the Fletching and Moondrop

119
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:25,159
Carnival of Curiosities.

120
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,063
TALIESIN: Traveling Carnival of Curiosities.

121
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:35,230
MATT: Upon entering the tent, they saw a number of
performances. However, during a musical performance

122
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:41,738
by this young dwarven girl whose voice was this
mysterious, magically enchanting experience, a

123
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:51,043
member of the audience rose up and began to
transform into a terrible undead creature that

124
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:55,365
began to lash out, killing another member of the
audience, who then began to become one of these

125
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:59,708
same creatures. You all, grabbing your weapons
from Yasha, who had been keeping them stashed

126
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:04,801
away, leapt into the fray, slaughtered both of
these terrible beasts, just in time for the

127
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:12,111
crownsguard to rush in and ask you what the hell
happened. After information had been gathered of

128
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:19,307
who was immediately available and responsible for
this carnival, Gustav, Bo the Breaker, and Molly

129
00:10:19,307 --> 00:10:24,211
were marked to be arrested. One of the guards was
escorted outside of the tent by Yasha, who was

130
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:30,124
going to show him where this young dwarven girl
was currently resting, and upon being led astray

131
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:36,764
to the wrong tent, she just ran into the distant
hills and vanished. And that is where we left off.

132
00:10:36,764 --> 00:10:39,331
SAM: So we're still at the carnival?

133
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:40,923
MATT: You're still in the tent.

134
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:42,174
LIAM: With crownsguard?

135
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:52,085
MATT: With the crownsguard and with Watchmaster
Jossyd. The crownsguard that had left naught but a

136
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:58,412
moment before comes rushing in, his breath
huffing, sweat dripping from his brow, his eyes

137
00:10:58,412 --> 00:11:07,280
wild. He goes, "Watchmaster! The big woman is
gone! She's gone!" The Watchmaster turns to him

138
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:14,254
and says, "You three, go with him. Search for
her." They all immediately run out back out the

139
00:11:14,254 --> 00:11:19,188
performer's flap and he turns to the rest of you
in the group, "Shackle and drag those three down

140
00:11:19,188 --> 00:11:26,015
"to the stockade." About five guards approach and
begin to press Gustav, Bo, and Molly to the ground

141
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:28,150
and begin to put chains and shackles on them.

142
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:32,371
TALIESIN: I'd like to make a counteroffer?

143
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:43,589
MATT: He's in mid-speech, "The rest of you keep an
eye on the performers here. Ask around, see what

144
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:48,009
"you can find. As for the others, don't go far."

145
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:50,255
LAURA: The innocent patrons, you mean?

146
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:55,537
MATT: "You may be innocent, in which case you have
nothing to worry about. However, we have an

147
00:11:55,537 --> 00:12:02,274
"investigation to complete, so I would ask that you
stay in the city and wait until you are called in.

148
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:06,399
"You will be questioned, and when this
investigation is completed, regardless of how long

149
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,011
"it may take, you are not to leave Trostenwald."

150
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:14,706
LIAM: If I could just contribute one word, the 40
or so people who are outside and the rest of us

151
00:12:14,706 --> 00:12:22,053
will vouch for this one, the colorful one. He
saved many people's lives. Don't take my word for

152
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:24,139
it. There's everyone outside.

153
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:30,764
MATT: All the rest of the crownsguard glance to
each other, he goes, "Well, unfortunately, that is

154
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:36,537
"not for me to decide. The Lawmaster would have to
be appealed to. If you wish to come with us, we

155
00:12:36,537 --> 00:12:41,306
"can bring you along with us to the stockade and
you can speak with her. Then, perhaps, she may

156
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:44,244
"grant you leniency, but I can give you no
guarantee."

157
00:12:44,244 --> 00:12:51,971
MARISHA: Why don't you just question us right now?
I'm confused on why you don't just do that now.

158
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:58,104
MATT: "Well, we could do that instead. We'll
have you arrested, put you in the stockade as we

159
00:12:58,104 --> 00:12:59,503
"question the rest of you."

160
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:01,615
LAURA: No, let's go to the stockade.

161
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,722
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll all be in one place.

162
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:05,236
LAURA: Yeah.

163
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:12,378
MARISHA: Jails are not my favored terrain. Just
want to point that out. Not this go-around. No.

164
00:13:12,378 --> 00:13:14,160
TRAVIS: Good to know.

165
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,323
LAURA: I would have guessed that about you.

166
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:20,413
MARISHA: Not really comfortable with that.

167
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:28,450
MATT: "We're leaving. The rest of you, stay in here.
Watch over the performers. Make sure nobody

168
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:35,210
"leaves. Come if you wish. Otherwise, we'll be in
touch." The Watchmaster gathers alongside the

169
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,942
other five crownsguard, lifting up the shackles of
the three that had been arrested and begin to drag

170
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:41,168
them outside of the tent and into the night air.

171
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:42,947
LIAM: I send Frumpkin to follow.

172
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,232
MATT: Okay.

173
00:13:44,232 --> 00:13:49,086
MARISHA: Can I double back into the performance
area and see if I can find that little girl that

174
00:13:49,086 --> 00:13:51,153
they're looking for? Before they do?

175
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:54,942
MATT: You may, if you want to. So you send
Frumpkin just to follow them. You guys are staying

176
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:56,389
behind, then?

177
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:01,736
TRAVIS: Are there three regular crownsguard that
are going with Molly? Or is the Watchmaster going

178
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:03,038
with them as well?

179
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:06,086
MATT: The Watchmaster is going with them, or at
least he's exiting the tent with them. It looks

180
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:08,816
like there are five crownsguard attending the three
of them that are shackled.

181
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:13,436
TRAVIS: I'll go out the front exit of the tent
just to see if the Watchmaster goes with Molly.

182
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,855
MATT: Okay.

183
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:16,145
LAURA: I'll follow Fjord.

184
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:21,561
MATT: Okay, so the two of you are following.
Anybody with them? Currently, it's you two and

185
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,996
Frumpkin.

186
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:28,631
SAM: Are we going with them or not? Should we stay
here? This is not our affair, right?

187
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:33,111
LIAM: I don't know. I'm having second thoughts
about being here at all.

188
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:35,923
SAM: Well, you sent the kitty, didn't you?

189
00:14:35,923 --> 00:14:40,586
LIAM: Yes, and we're not going to leave without
him. Why don't we just--?

190
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:42,745
SAM: Follow behind a bit?

191
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:44,226
LIAM: That's right.

192
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:47,716
SAM: Okay. Sounds good.

193
00:14:47,716 --> 00:14:57,586
MATT: All right, so as you guys exit, keeping
a pace behind, watching the

194
00:14:57,586 --> 00:15:04,754
crownsguard guiding the current prisoners towards
the actual city, Frumpkin keeping a zig-zagging

195
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,476
distance behind and following.

196
00:15:06,476 --> 00:15:07,533
LIAM: DM?

197
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:08,331
MATT: Yes?

198
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:16,356
LIAM: Is it possible for me, if Nott is holding my
hand and leading me, to go full third eye and walk

199
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:20,768
blind and deaf here looking through Frumpkin's
senses?

200
00:15:20,768 --> 00:15:25,333
MATT: I would say yes, but you are purely like--
because all you're doing is walking forward and

201
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,525
you need someone to guide you.

202
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:27,413
LIAM: Right.

203
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:29,160
SAM: And he can't communicate to me either so--

204
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,649
LIAM: I can talk, but I can't hear you. I can talk
and hold her hand so she can stop me from

205
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:37,484
prat-falling all over myself.

206
00:15:37,484 --> 00:15:39,095
SAM: Yes. But you can talk?

207
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:41,090
MATT: He can talk but he can't hear you.

208
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,580
SAM: Got it. Okay. Great.

209
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:48,865
LIAM: But we've done this before so you know to
squeeze my hand really hard if I should pipe down.

210
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,373
SAM: Sure.

211
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:53,139
MATT: All right. So, first off, Beauregard.

212
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:54,187
MARISHA: Yeah.

213
00:15:54,187 --> 00:16:00,488
MATT: As you back out of the performer's exit of
the tent into the center of their encampment, the

214
00:16:00,488 --> 00:16:08,120
immediate exit, there are already four crownsguard
currently searching around and setting up a watch

215
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,274
perimeter around the different tents. They're
gathering and making sure none of the other

216
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:16,003
performers have fled and a lot of them are being
brought out into an area where there's a number of

217
00:16:16,003 --> 00:16:19,712
tents all facing towards a large campfire in the
center. There's a couple of chairs set up there,

218
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,913
it's kind of the common area for the performers of
the carnival and it looks like they're all being

219
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:27,147
put out there so they can get a bead on it and
make sure they know where everyone else is.

220
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:34,815
MARISHA: I'm going to try to be aloof, stealth a
little bit. I don't want to make myself completely known.

221
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:38,705
MATT: Are you trying to stealth out of sight or
just trying to not draw attention?

222
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:40,629
MARISHA: No, just trying not to draw attention.

223
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:45,682
MATT: Okay, all right. Go and make a stealth check
just to see if--

224
00:16:45,682 --> 00:16:48,231
SAM: Wait, did we just all ditch Marisha?

225
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:49,706
LAURA: She just walked out.

226
00:16:49,706 --> 00:16:59,274
MARISHA: I ditched you. That's cocked. That's
better. 17.

227
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:06,058
MATT: 17. Okay. As you kind of dart through the
flap of the tent and move behind one of the large

228
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:12,758
carts that currently is still affixed to a horse
that is currently just chewing on an apple, and

229
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:16,483
you hear the crunch in its teeth, you glance over
past the edge of the immediate near tent and you

230
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:20,624
can see this group gathering there and it appears
that no one's immediately aware of your presence.

231
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:24,737
MARISHA: Do I see the little girl whose name was--
what was her name?

232
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:30,561
MATT: Toya. You do not see her yet. The guard just
got out there and they're just beginning to pull

233
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:41,021
people out. You do see the fire dancer brought out
there. You then see the two-- Yeah, Ornna. The

234
00:17:41,021 --> 00:17:45,383
Knot sisters are brought out and pushed out there
and they're all looking very frustrated.

235
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:46,874
MARISHA: Are people being amicable?

236
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:50,717
MATT: Yeah, they're not shoving them around,
they're just calling them out to the front so they

237
00:17:50,717 --> 00:17:52,071
know where they are.

238
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:57,156
MARISHA: Okay. I want to look around. Do I see any
type of movement in the shadows, anyone looking

239
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:58,398
suspicious?

240
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:00,280
MATT: Make a perception check.

241
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:06,805
MARISHA: Ooh yeah! Natural 18. 21.

242
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:15,523
MATT: 21. Okay, as you glance about, you don't see
anything lurking in the shadows. What you do

243
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:23,840
notice, though, is one of them bring Toya out of
one of the-- the tent that's on the southern side and

244
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:31,288
as he brings her out, there's a heavy thud sound,
and you see coming out from behind the tent the

245
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:37,705
large form of-- you heard the name Kylre once, but
the ''devil toad." The obese lizard man who's

246
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:39,470
stomping up behind.

247
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,967
LAURA: Is he a dude or is he a creature?

248
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:51,290
MATT: It looks like a lizard man, so scaled,
humanoid, but extremely thick, bulbous belly,

249
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,828
large, almost frog-like legs--

250
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:57,637
TRAVIS: Bipedal or on all fours?

251
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:03,428
MATT: Due to the size of his form, mostly all
fours and lumbering forward on all of them but

252
00:19:03,428 --> 00:19:06,683
sits back on a bipedal situation.

253
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:08,685
MARISHA: So they're bringing the both of them out?

254
00:19:08,685 --> 00:19:14,750
MATT: The toad is hiding behind the tent and as
soon as Toya comes out, comes up to the guard and

255
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:21,113
puffs up its chest. The guard spins around and
goes for the blade and pulls it out just carefully.

256
00:19:21,113 --> 00:19:23,439
MARISHA: Am I still next to that horse?

257
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:35,192
MATT: The horse is currently still up on the cart,
but is about 30 feet from you.

258
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:37,384
SAM: Beast Shape!

259
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,486
(laughter)

260
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:48,441
MARISHA: I'm going to take my staff and give a
really nice whack to the horse to get it to run.

261
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:51,781
MATT: You know what? Let's go ahead and make an
animal handling check on that.

262
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:53,720
SAM: We never get to make those!

263
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,778
LIAM: First of the show!

264
00:19:55,778 --> 00:20:01,032
MARISHA: Oh my god, I'm so nervous right now.

265
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:02,621
TRAVIS: You're good, you're good, you're good.

266
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:05,126
MARISHA: That's not great. 11?

267
00:20:05,126 --> 00:20:09,702
MATT: 11 will do. It wasn't a hard DC, but it was
more knowing where to hit it to where it would

268
00:20:09,702 --> 00:20:12,233
cause it to bolt versus just get angry.

269
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:14,105
MARISHA: Get pissed, sure, kick me.

270
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:20,205
MATT: So going for-- not to actually hurt the
creature but just enough to spook it, you hit it

271
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:24,169
in the right place towards the back of its
hindquarters to cause it to suddenly rear up

272
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:29,696
(neighs) (cart clattering noise) and go into a
sprint. The cart begins to bounce and smash onto

273
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:33,635
the ground. You can see the wheels clattering into
the rocks and the stone between the bits of--

274
00:20:33,635 --> 00:20:38,401
MARISHA: I'm going to bolt in the opposite direction and
try and loop around to the south side of the tent.

275
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:39,855
MATT: Make another stealth check, please.

276
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:45,155
MARISHA: Big dice, big dice. Okay, 19!

277
00:20:45,155 --> 00:20:53,114
MATT: Okay. You dart around the north side of
these tents and you're pretty sure you weren't

278
00:20:53,114 --> 00:20:59,761
seen. As the cart begins to bolt off behind this
horse, you see all the crownsguard turn. The one

279
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:03,946
that was currently staring at the devil toad
glances off to the side. As he glances off, the

280
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:09,932
devil toad takes Toya and just pulls her to him
protectively and the guard puts his sword away.

281
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:16,577
"Check!" Points to them and then bolts off to go
after the horse. The other three stay, watching

282
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:17,862
over the group.

283
00:21:17,862 --> 00:21:19,769
MARISHA: Okay, can I loop around, kind of come up
behind them?

284
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:21,968
MATT: I mean, they're scattered a bit but
there's--

285
00:21:21,968 --> 00:21:23,636
MARISHA: The devil toad and Toya.

286
00:21:23,636 --> 00:21:27,835
MATT: Oh yeah. Make another stealth check. You're
running through open areas each time you're doing this.

287
00:21:27,835 --> 00:21:37,507
MARISHA: Yep. (yells) Did you see that?! It leaned
to a four. Ten.

288
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:39,323
TRAVIS: That is a bastard die right there.

289
00:21:39,323 --> 00:21:40,356
MARISHA: That sucked.

290
00:21:40,356 --> 00:21:41,579
TRAVIS: That's a tease.

291
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:43,231
MARISHA: Laura, put him in the dice jail.

292
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:47,493
LAURA: I don't have my dice jail out yet. It's
okay, he'll chill there.

293
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:53,385
MATT: As you come up around the back of the devil
toad, the guard that runs past doesn't immediately

294
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:58,008
notice you because he's focused on where this cart
is running off and you can see another guard that

295
00:21:58,008 --> 00:22:02,242
was far away from this encampment that's circling
back with him. The two of them are now bolting in

296
00:22:02,242 --> 00:22:05,953
the direction as the cart begins to slow. It's not
just going forward forever but it spooked him and

297
00:22:05,953 --> 00:22:09,634
it's starting to slow down. They're just going to
inspect it. However, as you slink up behind, the

298
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:16,123
devil toad's head curls back towards you and you
hear this deep, guttural (growls).

299
00:22:16,123 --> 00:22:24,234
MARISHA: "Okay. It's okay. Toya?" And I look at
Toya. "Hey, come on, let's get out of here, let's go."

300
00:22:24,234 --> 00:22:28,315
MATT: At which point a voice says, "Excuse me?!"

301
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:32,787
And you can see the three guards are there
staring at you.

302
00:22:32,787 --> 00:22:35,969
MARISHA: Fuck. You didn't say there were fucking
guards.

303
00:22:35,969 --> 00:22:39,550
MATT: I did say there were three guards. The three
guards watching them.

304
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,570
MARISHA: I thought you said they left.

305
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,007
MATT: One of them left.

306
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:45,806
MARISHA: One of them left. So wait. Oh shit.

307
00:22:45,806 --> 00:22:50,321
MATT: It's a bad stealth check, I'm sorry. But
there's now three crownsguard right there and

308
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:52,164
they're like, "Can I help you?"

309
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:53,684
TRAVIS: Time to go to jail.

310
00:22:53,684 --> 00:22:56,255
LAURA: Oh, this is so exciting.

311
00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:58,769
SAM: Kill them all.

312
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:05,517
MARISHA: Ey! I was actually just looking for the
loo?

313
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:13,271
MATT: The guard that's closest to you glances to
the other guys and goes, "She was with the group,

314
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:20,894
"right?" They recognize you, and they look at each
other. "You're going to the stockade, my dear."

315
00:23:20,894 --> 00:23:23,365
MARISHA: No!

316
00:23:23,365 --> 00:23:28,263
MATT: The three guards slowly approach and they
begin to take out chains and manacle you up.

317
00:23:28,263 --> 00:23:33,286
SAM: In an effort not to go to jail, you went &lt;i>to&lt;/i>
the jail.

318
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:37,608
MARISHA: I'm trying to get the girl. I was trying
to free the damn girl.

319
00:23:37,608 --> 00:23:39,061
MATT: I know.

320
00:23:39,061 --> 00:23:42,105
TALIESIN: You'll be fine.

321
00:23:42,105 --> 00:23:47,211
MATT: So you're shackled and begin to be dragged
toward the stockade.

322
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:51,335
MARISHA: It's just the two guards, right?

323
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:55,019
MATT: It's the two guards now. As you're being
brought back, you can see more guards are coming

324
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:59,179
from the city to the carnival. They're keeping it
under surveillance.

325
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:00,963
MARISHA: So are they taking me away?

326
00:24:00,963 --> 00:24:02,454
MATT: They're taking you to the city, yeah.

327
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:04,622
MARISHA: What are they doing with Toya? Anything?
Are they leaving them behind?

328
00:24:04,622 --> 00:24:07,612
MATT: They're leaving them behind currently with
the guards that are there. They're not arresting

329
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:13,615
anybody from the carnival, but they're not letting
them leave. But they're keeping them there.

330
00:24:13,615 --> 00:24:21,617
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to do a quick--

331
00:24:21,617 --> 00:24:23,164
SAM: Kill them all.

332
00:24:23,164 --> 00:24:24,942
MARISHA: I'm in shackles?

333
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:26,218
MATT: You are.

334
00:24:26,218 --> 00:24:31,726
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to do some monk shit
here. I'm going to elbow one of the guards. Right

335
00:24:31,726 --> 00:24:36,898
in the ribs. And take the other one and bash the
other one in the face and then I'm going to turn

336
00:24:36,898 --> 00:24:41,375
to Toya and I'm going to say, "Run! Run! Go! Run!"

337
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:45,215
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and--

338
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:47,019
SAM: Make all kinds of rolls.

339
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,950
MATT: First, go ahead and make an athletics check.

340
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:54,935
MARISHA and SAM: This is a terrible idea.

341
00:24:54,935 --> 00:25:01,416
LAURA: To not drag any attention towards her, you
are completely shoving her into the limelight.

342
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:08,592
MARISHA: Trying to distract these fucking
assholes. That is a six. Ten.

343
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:17,932
MATT: As you go back to elbow, you get halfway
there before your chains go taut. They're both

344
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:22,631
holding the chain at each side, and you see the
tension of it; you can't even get him from behind.

345
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:27,854
You imagine in your head; you go over it two or
three times. As you go through the first step--

346
00:25:27,854 --> 00:25:30,086
(grunt) doesn't go anywhere.

347
00:25:30,086 --> 00:25:31,988
TRAVIS: Tried to do the Sherlock Holmes.

348
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:37,409
MARISHA: Do I at least get the "Run!" out to
Toya?

349
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:40,589
MATT: No. I'm sorry.

350
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:44,088
MARISHA: Is she just standing there? Waiting for a
guard?

351
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:46,863
TRAVIS: She sees you having a seizure in the
chains.

352
00:25:46,863 --> 00:25:49,207
(laughter)

353
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:55,056
MARISHA: What is she doing? Is she running?

354
00:25:55,056 --> 00:26:01,691
MATT: No. Honestly, the devil toad and her seem
pretty close. He is grabbing her in a protective manner.

355
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:10,432
MARISHA: No, they can both run. Run for your life!
Fine, whatever. She wants to get arrested at this point.

356
00:26:10,432 --> 00:26:15,873
MATT: Two bad rolls in a row. I know. Level two.

357
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:18,526
MARISHA: I go join my friends.

358
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:29,219
MATT: You will shortly. Ahead of her, along the
way, Gustav is just quiet. Bo the Breaker, Bosun,

359
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:36,344
as you know him by his full name, is grumbling
under his breath and is trying to out-loud piece

360
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:43,444
together thoughts on what may have what
transpired, saying things like, "I don't know, you

361
00:26:43,444 --> 00:26:48,686
"think it's done on the inside? Or is this somebody
trying to sabotage it?"

362
00:26:48,686 --> 00:26:52,015
TALIESIN: I think maybe it has nothing to do with
us. I think maybe we were just caught in the crossfire.

363
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:53,796
MATT: It is quite possible.

364
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:57,383
TALIESIN: Sorry, sir. Trying to keep my mouth
shut.

365
00:26:57,383 --> 00:27:02,483
MATT: One of the guards tugs on both of your
chains and says, "Quiet now! Save it for the

366
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:10,102
"lawmaster." They bring you in-- you go in through
the Lochward into the Hillsward, which is the

367
00:27:10,102 --> 00:27:13,299
southern portion of Trostenwald. You are brought
to the outside of the stockade, which is a large

368
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:21,559
single-story, tall, rectangular building of large
stones and masonry. It's built for function. It's

369
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:27,564
not a very beautiful building, but it's
defensible and it seems fairly well-made. However,

370
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:31,195
there are the banners of the crownsguard marking
the double-door entrance. As you're brought

371
00:27:31,195 --> 00:27:35,909
within, you can already see there are two central
chairs where two current watch sit, just watching

372
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:43,060
the front door. Beyond the right, you see, is an
office that you guys are dragged to-- and the rest

373
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:48,297
of you eventually catch up to the group. You are all
brought inside this darkened office. Inside,

374
00:27:48,297 --> 00:27:55,162
relatively simple. This isn't a library-type study
office. This is very much for function. There's a

375
00:27:55,162 --> 00:28:00,300
couple of small crates that contain materials that
are too far in shadow to see the details of it.

376
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,954
Look to be pieces of paper, probably gathered
evidence or weapons that have been reclaimed.

377
00:28:03,954 --> 00:28:13,279
There is a stone desk on the far end, and there,
within this office, already accompanied by a

378
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,951
messenger dressed for immediate travel, is a tough-looking 
dwarven woman in her middle years rapidly

379
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:23,602
scrawling on parchment. Her black hair is streaked
with silver, tumbling past her red and gray

380
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:27,101
leather armor. She finishes writing on this
parchment, rolls it up, and hands it to the

381
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:32,469
messenger who immediately darts out of the room
without a word past you guys, giving you a brief

382
00:28:32,469 --> 00:28:37,175
look as he continues on whatever his business is.
As soon as your eyes pass off the messenger, you

383
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:42,719
hear a loud slam, and you glance back. She's put
her hands on the table. She glances up, "All

384
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:51,381
"right, what riff-raff have you brought in to me
this day?" The watchmaster takes the chains of the

385
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:59,337
three of you and pulls you to the front of the
group and says, "Sorry to be a bother, but we have

386
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:04,463
"three individuals arrested in connection with, as
you have heard so far, the deaths at the carnival

387
00:29:04,463 --> 00:29:12,834
"performance this evening." She rolls her eyes.
"All right, bring them forward." They go ahead and

388
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:19,772
pull the chains up. The watchmaster bows his head
and then leaves the room. She steps forward and

389
00:29:19,772 --> 00:29:30,601
goes, "I am Norda. It is my job to keep this city
safe and keep shite like what happened tonight

390
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:37,994
"from happening. I approved your second time on the
outskirts of our town and you have killed two of

391
00:29:37,994 --> 00:29:42,421
"my people. What have you to say about yourselves?"

392
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:45,865
TALIESIN: Exactly how did we kill them, exactly?

393
00:29:45,865 --> 00:29:55,394
MATT: She glances over at you. Glances over at
Gustav, "I have been told by my guard that you

394
00:29:55,394 --> 00:30:01,372
"gave performance, and as part of this performance
you released two beasts into the midst of the

395
00:30:01,372 --> 00:30:03,169
"population."

396
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:07,964
LAURA: Well, technically, he wasn't part of the
performance, technically he was saving everyone.

397
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:09,518
Technically.

398
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:14,673
TALIESIN: Thank you. Yes, you see--

399
00:30:14,673 --> 00:30:21,137
MATT: Gustav interrupts you and says, "I'm so
sorry, my liege. Please, I take full

400
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:25,809
"responsibility for what happened this evening on
myself. These people around me had nothing to do

401
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:32,306
"with this. They are not part of the carnival, they
were just merely helping. It is my carnival, and

402
00:30:32,306 --> 00:30:37,005
"whatever judgement there lies, I take upon myself
and my head." At which point Bo the half-orc steps

403
00:30:37,005 --> 00:30:42,712
forward, against his chains and goes, "Gustav,
what are you doing?" He's like, "Shut. Up. Please,

404
00:30:42,712 --> 00:30:52,088
whatever judgement there is, put it upon me," and
he bows his head low. "Is that the case? Is he the

405
00:30:52,088 --> 00:31:04,307
"only one?" She takes a good, hard look at you and
Bo the Breaker.

406
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:08,561
TALIESIN: Oh, are you waiting for me to speak?
Yes, he's the only one.

407
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:12,063
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

408
00:31:12,063 --> 00:31:19,565
TALIESIN: Natural 20. About fucking time, you
little shit!

409
00:31:19,565 --> 00:31:27,303
MATT: She gives you a look. Looks over at Bo the
Breaker. Shakes her head. "Keep these two

410
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:37,203
downstairs. This one let go. He seems to be free.
We'll be talking to you very soon." At which

411
00:31:37,203 --> 00:31:41,624
point, the crownsguard drag the chains back and
Gustav gives you a quick look under his eye and

412
00:31:41,624 --> 00:31:49,292
goes-- as they're pulled out of the room, out of
sight. She glances to you, "Well, you're out of

413
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:56,303
chains! That's great. Doesn't mean you're absolved
of the investigation. So, where are you staying?

414
00:31:56,303 --> 00:31:59,817
You and your compatriots?"

415
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:03,724
LAURA: Well, technically we just all met,
technically.

416
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:08,227
MATT: "Well, technically, as far as I'm concerned,
you're all together as part of this

417
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:09,813
investigation."

418
00:32:09,813 --> 00:32:11,928
LAURA: We're a group you guys!

419
00:32:11,928 --> 00:32:16,980
(laughter)

420
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:22,922
MATT: "So we're going to have our investigators
come to wherever you're staying, which--," and she

421
00:32:22,922 --> 00:32:27,478
looks down at some papers here, "-- looks to be
the Nestled Nook?"

422
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,069
TRAVIS: That's correct.

423
00:32:29,069 --> 00:32:34,136
MATT: "All right. Don't leave the city. We'll be
in touch."

424
00:32:34,136 --> 00:32:41,816
LAURA: Great, I really like it here so that's good
that we get to stay so long.

425
00:32:41,816 --> 00:32:44,071
MATT: "Do you have something to say?"

426
00:32:44,071 --> 00:32:51,536
TALIESIN: No. Just shocked to see someone die in
front of me not more than--

427
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:55,494
TRAVIS: I can assure you, we're here to cause no
trouble. We will be as compliant as we possibly

428
00:32:55,494 --> 00:32:58,221
can be.

429
00:32:58,221 --> 00:33:07,678
MATT: "Good. Dismissed!" She claps the edge of the
table. The remaining crownsguard, who's left there

430
00:33:07,678 --> 00:33:13,674
to keep watch, escorts you out off the stockade,
escorts you onto the street.

431
00:33:13,674 --> 00:33:18,189
LAURA: Her accent is really strong! It's hard to
not match her accent!

432
00:33:18,189 --> 00:33:21,356
(laughter)

433
00:33:21,356 --> 00:33:23,459
TALIESIN: It's the one accent that I really have
trouble with.

434
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,457
TRAVIS: Would you call it infectious?

435
00:33:25,457 --> 00:33:27,251
TALIESIN: Bastard.

436
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:28,336
MATT: Sorry.

437
00:33:28,336 --> 00:33:31,782
TALIESIN: The one that we know is a problem.

438
00:33:31,782 --> 00:33:39,401
LIAM: I'm going to call my cat back to me and I
drop the telepathy and I just start tugging you

439
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:44,280
back to the Nestled Nook. Come on, we have to talk
about this. We have to decide what we're going to do.

440
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,516
SAM: Right away.

441
00:33:45,516 --> 00:33:46,459
TRAVIS: Excuse me--

442
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:47,545
LAURA: They're not with us.

443
00:33:47,545 --> 00:33:49,182
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought you were right behind us.

444
00:33:49,182 --> 00:33:50,613
LIAM: My cat was in there, but not I.

445
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:53,270
MATT: Yeah, but you'd have to stay within 100 feet
to maintain that.

446
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:58,162
LIAM: Well, we would've walked up to the building,
the cat would've scurried around, if possible. So

447
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:01,852
I'd like to think that I heard all that, which is
why just I said all the things I did.

448
00:34:01,852 --> 00:34:05,594
MATT: You did hear all that. Okay, and I'd say, as
they're making their way out, you can probably

449
00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:11,518
duck around without them seeing you as they left.
Yeah, you can do that. So, you guys are jettisoned

450
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:16,356
into the street. It's now probably just past
midnight.

451
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:20,512
TRAVIS: Mollymauk, I don't mean to pry into your
business, but has this ever happened to you

452
00:34:20,512 --> 00:34:21,793
before?

453
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:26,411
TALIESIN: This has never-- anything like this has
ever happened before. And thank you. For the

454
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:29,833
record, I don't owe any of you anything--

455
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,481
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't know about that.

456
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:36,217
TALIESIN: --I swear, but thank you, and I'm ready
to help with this.

457
00:34:36,217 --> 00:34:38,434
LAURA: Do you think it was the little girl?

458
00:34:38,434 --> 00:34:44,869
TALIESIN: No! That's an act, that's not anything.
It's just a show!

459
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:51,427
TRAVIS: Right, the large toad that was with the
girl, what's the story there?

460
00:34:51,427 --> 00:34:58,717
TALIESIN: It's nothing special, it's just a guy
making a buck, all right? He's fine!

461
00:34:58,717 --> 00:35:04,021
MATT: You hear the footfalls of guards approach
and the rattle of chains as you see Beauregard--

462
00:35:04,021 --> 00:35:08,065
TALIESIN: By the way, where's the obnoxious one?
The really loud--

463
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:11,621
MATT: As opposed the rest of you who are gingerly
brought up, you see Beauregard being pulled

464
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:15,626
forward but now the chains around her are being
pulled taught on two sides. She's being brought

465
00:35:15,626 --> 00:35:17,842
forward like a wild animal almost.

466
00:35:17,842 --> 00:35:20,121
MATT: And she's just being led towards the
stockade.

467
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:21,331
MARISHA: Help.

468
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:22,228
LAURA: What happened?

469
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:24,565
MARISHA: Help. Help help help. Help help. Help
help help.

470
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:26,222
(laughter)

471
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:28,268
MARISHA: Help. I'm with you, I'm with you. Help
help.

472
00:35:28,268 --> 00:35:30,349
LAURA: Oh, I thought you didn't like jails.

473
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:34,690
MARISHA: (clears throat) Help.

474
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,277
TALIESIN: Is this part of the show by the way? I
was just curious.

475
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:40,414
TRAVIS: Unfortunately, no.

476
00:35:40,414 --> 00:35:44,735
MATT: Which is the last thing you see as she is
yanked into the stockade and out of sight.

477
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:47,259
TALIESIN: I'm going to be very helpful and not go
in there with the two of you while you try and get

478
00:35:47,259 --> 00:35:48,784
her out.

479
00:35:48,784 --> 00:35:50,800
LAURA: So should we go in and try to get her out?

480
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,592
TRAVIS: Well, yeah!

481
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:53,186
LAURA: Okay.

482
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:54,369
TALIESIN: I'll stand guard.

483
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:56,371
LAURA: We'll follow her in.

484
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:57,668
TRAVIS: Don't. Leave.

485
00:35:57,668 --> 00:35:59,623
TALIESIN: I have nowhere to go.

486
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:06,242
MATT: You walk in behind her. You watch her being
pulled to the stairs. She's bypassing the office

487
00:36:06,242 --> 00:36:12,606
of the Lawmaster right now and is being brought to
incarceration before being questioned. They bring

488
00:36:12,606 --> 00:36:17,927
her to the stairs and a torch-lit, subterranean
basement area. As you begin to approach and follow

489
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:23,101
behind, you can see one of the guards who is
currently on watch. He sees you guys just exit and

490
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:26,358
then walk back in, following another prisoner. And
stands up and goes, "I'm sorry, where are you

491
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:27,856
going?"

492
00:36:27,856 --> 00:36:36,893
TRAVIS: It was a busy day for us. Unfortunately,
we're partially responsible for this one as well.

493
00:36:36,893 --> 00:36:38,108
Bad luck.

494
00:36:38,108 --> 00:36:44,485
LAURA: She was also helping to save a lot of
people. Big misunderstanding.

495
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:48,643
MATT: "Well, see her into her cell and please exit
the vicinity."

496
00:36:48,643 --> 00:36:50,882
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

497
00:36:50,882 --> 00:36:56,489
MATT: "Appreciate that." He follows behind you
guys. They're on high alert and they're a bit

498
00:36:56,489 --> 00:37:01,518
scattered. You get the sense right now that they
have a lot of their initial stock of guards

499
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:06,456
off-site right now. So they're doing the best they
can to hold on to what they currently have in the

500
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:07,677
stockade.

501
00:37:07,677 --> 00:37:11,807
TRAVIS: To the side I say to Jester, I say: This
does not really fall in with keeping a low

502
00:37:11,807 --> 00:37:13,429
profile. We talked about this.

503
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:17,865
LAURA: I know isn't it so weird?

504
00:37:17,865 --> 00:37:21,085
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is.

505
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:27,548
MATT: You guys follow down to the basement portion
of this. Which there's a heavy locked door

506
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:34,193
immediately that is opened from the opposite side.
You hear a couple of keys turn and the shifting of

507
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:42,373
wood against metal before the door opens and
reveals the rest of a long hallway that is flanked

508
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:49,215
by two rows of cells. Iron bars about maybe two
inches apart going across the entirety of this

509
00:37:49,215 --> 00:37:54,454
long hallway. You can't quite see the end of it
until you step down to where the door frame is.

510
00:37:54,454 --> 00:38:00,967
And there is probably a total of ten cells to each
side. As you walk through, you can see in the off

511
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:06,438
shadows in the corners a few huddled bodies
hunched or asleep. Keeping to the shadows and out

512
00:38:06,438 --> 00:38:15,655
of the light. The smell of mildewed wet compost
and piss hits your nose like a wall.

513
00:38:15,655 --> 00:38:17,706
LAURA: It smells like Caleb down here.

514
00:38:17,706 --> 00:38:22,117
(laughter)

515
00:38:22,117 --> 00:38:28,367
MATT: You get about five cells in where you can
see the guard that was previously in there just

516
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:34,594
finish off closing the cell that contains both
Gustav and Bo the Breaker. They move to the cell

517
00:38:34,594 --> 00:38:41,074
just beyond that, open that cell, and then go
ahead and put Beauregard into that one.

518
00:38:41,074 --> 00:38:43,164
TRAVIS: Are they not going to take her to see the
Lawmaker?

519
00:38:43,164 --> 00:38:46,483
LAURA: I know, why doesn't she get to talk to the
Lawmaster?

520
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:53,101
MATT: As he closes and locks it, "Because she
decided not to come helpfully."

521
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:55,619
LAURA: What do you mean?

522
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:03,702
MARISHA: Ah, oh, no you misunderstood. See that
was just, I have this spasm that has this twitch.

523
00:39:03,702 --> 00:39:07,961
It was an injury from, like, a childhood thing.

524
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:12,286
LAURA: Oh no, are you guys making fun of her
because of her spasm?

525
00:39:12,286 --> 00:39:17,155
MARISHA: Yeah that's actually-- (fake crying) it
was very sensitive for me. I had a really tough

526
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:21,628
childhood. I was just trying to find a bathroom.

527
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:26,615
MATT: The three guards walk away, not caring. Who
were there previously and--

528
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:28,804
SAM: Spasm shaming.

529
00:39:28,804 --> 00:39:33,786
MATT: At this point, a man who is on the far end
of the hall walks up. And you can see him, he's a

530
00:39:33,786 --> 00:39:42,385
man with a heavy, bushy beard that obscures a lot
of a dark leather mantle, over a general cloth

531
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:50,070
tunic. He has burly arms, heavy torso, super
scrawny legs, a widow's peak, and he looks to be

532
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:56,949
the jailer. He walks up and puts his hand on the
bars and goes, "Oh well, if you want to be

533
00:39:56,949 --> 00:40:01,349
"patient, I'm sure the Lawmaster will be here
sometime in the morning and you can discuss

534
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:05,045
"whatever this business is. But if you want to say
goodbye, now's the time."

535
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:09,567
TRAVIS: Actually, we were just upstairs and it
would really help us if we could, perhaps,

536
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:14,150
expedite the process. Perhaps there's an
arrangement we could come to if she could see the

537
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,693
Lawmaster now.

538
00:40:16,693 --> 00:40:27,541
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm looking injured, man. I show
him my eight hit points of damage.

539
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:30,081
TALIESIN: How many kittens is that again?

540
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:33,755
MATT: That's sixteen kittens. Kittens have half of
a hit point, I don't think kittens have more than

541
00:40:33,755 --> 00:40:34,760
that.

542
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,786
LIAM: That's eight Frumpkins.

543
00:40:36,786 --> 00:40:39,177
TRAVIS: An audience is all we're asking for. No
favors.

544
00:40:39,177 --> 00:40:43,182
MARISHA: Yeah, this is just a wrong time, wrong
place thing.

545
00:40:43,182 --> 00:40:46,606
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

546
00:40:46,606 --> 00:40:49,050
SAM: Use it.

547
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,289
TRAVIS: God bless. 16.

548
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:55,284
MATT: He gives you a look and says, "All right,
but if she gets angry, it's not on me."

549
00:40:55,284 --> 00:40:57,304
TRAVIS: I understand. Thank you for your
understanding.

550
00:40:57,304 --> 00:41:01,306
LAURA: She's a very calm person. I've never seen
her angry, ever.

551
00:41:01,306 --> 00:41:06,657
MATT: He gives a whistle. Another crownsguard
comes up and approaches him and he goes, "I'm

552
00:41:06,657 --> 00:41:13,322
"sorry. Could you go and fetch the Lawmaster? They
are requesting an audience. If she gets angry,

553
00:41:13,322 --> 00:41:20,853
"just add it to this one's sentence." The guard
exits and a brief time by, you can hear the slight

554
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:27,208
muddled cursing of a dwarven female descending the
stairs. You can see she has an overcoat on, was

555
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:30,661
halfway out of the stockades finishing up her
evening in her office.

556
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:33,262
TRAVIS: Beau, remember your little sister.

557
00:41:33,262 --> 00:41:35,204
SAM: Oh, what? Little sister? What?

558
00:41:35,204 --> 00:41:39,277
LIAM: We're not there.

559
00:41:39,277 --> 00:41:45,467
MATT: So, as the Lawmaster approaches, now pulling
the coat over herself, she goes, "Okay, so you've

560
00:41:45,467 --> 00:41:52,476
"returned, apparently, needing to poke into what
business now before I go off and get some food?"

561
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:56,016
TRAVIS: I do hate to trouble you again, twice in
the same evening. It's incredibly inconvenient.

562
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:58,711
MATT: "I hate being troubled twice in the same
evening."

563
00:41:58,711 --> 00:42:03,338
TRAVIS: If we may, this sweet girl here was also
part of our party and she is quite the protective

564
00:42:03,338 --> 00:42:12,155
one. I'm afraid that she was also providing aid to
our fellows in that tent. I'm afraid her younger

565
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:19,161
sister was attacked in a similar way. I feel it's
only prudent to acknowledge that she was trying to

566
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:24,942
protect this young dwarven girl that performed in
the circus. She means no harm.

567
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,148
LAURA: It was an adopted sister.

568
00:42:28,148 --> 00:42:32,295
MARISHA: I practically raised her. It's a
sensitive subject.

569
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:38,889
MATT: Okay. I would like a deception check.

570
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:45,768
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah baby. 24. Natural 18.

571
00:42:45,768 --> 00:42:51,246
MATT: Modified by their answers.

572
00:42:51,246 --> 00:42:53,047
LAURA: I was helping!

573
00:42:53,047 --> 00:42:58,168
TRAVIS: I'm new at this stat! Don't fuck it up!

574
00:42:58,168 --> 00:43:02,856
MATT: She gives a narrow look through her eyes,
looks to one of the other guards that you can see

575
00:43:02,856 --> 00:43:10,554
standing in the back, a familiar one to you, Beau,
and goes, "Is this true?" He goes, "It appeared to

576
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:20,467
"us that she was attempting to escape upon us
trying to bring calm to a very tense situation,

577
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:29,614
"but I'll leave it in your realm, Lawmaster." She
looks back. "So your sister, apparently, is part

578
00:43:29,614 --> 00:43:32,492
"of this scenario as well?"

579
00:43:32,492 --> 00:43:37,014
MARISHA: Adopted sister.

580
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:40,144
MATT: "Okay. Well, your sister's under
investigation."

581
00:43:40,144 --> 00:43:44,655
MARISHA: Sure.

582
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:47,327
LAURA: She's staying at the same place that we
are.

583
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:51,297
TRAVIS: Indeed. And we can be found at any hour.
The Nestled Nook Inn is where we are.

584
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:56,275
MARISHA: And I'm more than willing to be compliant
with the investigation. In fact, you can see the

585
00:43:56,275 --> 00:44:03,621
injury the beast left on my ribs, so if you want
to test it for any type of specimen samples, feel

586
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:09,282
free. It's very painful, but I'm willing to do it
for the cause.

587
00:44:09,282 --> 00:44:10,936
LAURA: Do you need me to heal that?

588
00:44:10,936 --> 00:44:14,523
MARISHA (through gritted teeth): No! For the
cause! Do it for the cause!

589
00:44:14,523 --> 00:44:18,931
MATT: At which she looks to you now and goes, "Are
you saying you might have been infected by this

590
00:44:18,931 --> 00:44:21,485
"beast?"

591
00:44:21,485 --> 00:44:29,670
MARISHA: No. It's a separate issue. There was two
things going on. There was, like, the big angry

592
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:35,097
toad beast and he got a swipe at me. And then
there were people who were getting attacked.

593
00:44:35,097 --> 00:44:39,201
MATT: "Theeds!" And she looks over to the jailer,
who goes, "Aye?" And she goes, "Could you have a

594
00:44:39,201 --> 00:44:41,864
"look at this wound for me real fast? I want to
make sure this isn't something that's going to

595
00:44:41,864 --> 00:44:42,965
"spread."

596
00:44:42,965 --> 00:44:44,681
MARISHA: Yeah! Yeah. Uh-huh.

597
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:46,992
TRAVIS: A great idea indeed. And thankfully there
was no flesh-to-flesh contact.

598
00:44:46,992 --> 00:44:48,393
MARISHA: Nope.

599
00:44:48,393 --> 00:44:54,460
LAURA: Yeah. The big zombie beast especially was
using a lot of, like, sticks and stuff to attack

600
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,697
people more than any kind of mouth.

601
00:44:57,697 --> 00:45:02,215
(laughter)

602
00:45:02,215 --> 00:45:09,710
MATT: The jailer, Theeds, takes a quick look at
the wound and he goes, "No, it appears to mainly

603
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:19,016
"be just bludgeoning. I mean, we'll keep a close
eye on her." You can see now the Lawmaster is

604
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:23,603
rubbing her eyes in frustration and goes, "I just
want to sleep."

605
00:45:23,603 --> 00:45:28,175
TRAVIS: Indeed. It would give us no greater
pleasure than to get out of your hair.

606
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:37,768
MATT: "Fine. We'll have guards posted at the
outside of the inn. You're not to leave until this

607
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:45,344
"investigation is complete. It may take days. Until
we find out who's responsible for these deaths and

608
00:45:45,344 --> 00:45:50,710
"bring them to justice, you are not to leave the
tavern."

609
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:51,762
TRAVIS: Understood.

610
00:45:51,762 --> 00:45:57,356
LAURA: Like, at all during the day, even? Just a
question. If we wanted to shop or something. Not

611
00:45:57,356 --> 00:45:59,090
okay?

612
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,733
MATT: "Not until this is done."

613
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:01,918
LAURA: Cool.

614
00:46:01,918 --> 00:46:05,443
MATT: "Because otherwise, you're welcome to stay
here, instead."

615
00:46:05,443 --> 00:46:10,394
LAURA: It is really beautiful here, but I think
I'd rather stay at the inn?

616
00:46:10,394 --> 00:46:15,699
TRAVIS: Indeed we would. This is most gracious of
you, Lawmaster Norda.

617
00:46:15,699 --> 00:46:20,103
MATT: "Get them the fuck out." She turns around
and sighs heavily as she stomps out of the

618
00:46:20,103 --> 00:46:30,478
chamber. The jailer opens the cell door and allows
Beauregard back out, and he looks a bit confused

619
00:46:30,478 --> 00:46:37,987
but amused at the same time. The guards that had
originally arrested you escort you out, not

620
00:46:37,987 --> 00:46:46,972
leaving any element of their sight off of you.
They escort you guys to the actual inn itself, to

621
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:53,755
the bottom floor of the Nestled Nook Inn, watch
you enter, and then post up right outside the main

622
00:46:53,755 --> 00:46:56,342
entrance to the tavern.

623
00:46:56,342 --> 00:46:59,362
LAURA: You should have spasmed a couple times on
the way here.

624
00:46:59,362 --> 00:47:00,829
MARISHA: Aw, shit.

625
00:47:00,829 --> 00:47:02,929
LAURA: Yeah. Opportunity missed.

626
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:05,507
MARISHA: My little sister? What the what?

627
00:47:05,507 --> 00:47:07,760
LAURA: She's a dwarf! She's human!

628
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:13,117
TRAVIS: What? No, I was trying to say she had a
little sister that had a similar incident and that

629
00:47:13,117 --> 00:47:16,646
made you try to protect Toya. I was trying to
throw you a bone.

630
00:47:16,646 --> 00:47:19,043
LAURA: Oh. You didn't make that clear at all.

631
00:47:19,043 --> 00:47:21,242
MATT: Are you guys up in your room, or are you in
the tavern?

632
00:47:21,242 --> 00:47:22,543
LIAM: Yeah. We're having a talk.

633
00:47:22,543 --> 00:47:24,914
TRAVIS: We're under watch.

634
00:47:24,914 --> 00:47:26,594
MARISHA: I was just trying to go with what you
said.

635
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:28,686
TRAVIS: Yeah. You did all right.

636
00:47:28,686 --> 00:47:34,219
MARISHA: All right. I mean, it kind of worked. But
you're not entirely wrong! I was trying to go get

637
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:38,137
the stupid little girl, who seemed to be stupid.

638
00:47:38,137 --> 00:47:39,882
TRAVIS: Did you see anything?

639
00:47:39,882 --> 00:47:43,182
MARISHA: I tried to save her. I was like, get the
hint, what's going on?

640
00:47:43,182 --> 00:47:46,106
LAURA: Why would you save her? She turned those
people into zombies.

641
00:47:46,106 --> 00:47:47,724
MARISHA: (stammers)

642
00:47:47,724 --> 00:47:49,021
TRAVIS: We don't know that.

643
00:47:49,021 --> 00:47:50,440
LAURA: I mean, she could have.

644
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,833
TALIESIN: She didn't.

645
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:54,237
LAURA: Oh, hi! You're here.

646
00:47:54,237 --> 00:48:00,358
MARISHA: Yeah, if anything, we should be looking
at this guy. Why are we putting our neck out for

647
00:48:00,358 --> 00:48:02,472
you?

648
00:48:02,472 --> 00:48:06,302
TALIESIN: You're putting your neck out for Toya
for some strange reason and I don't know why,

649
00:48:06,302 --> 00:48:08,179
she's perfectly capable of handling herself.

650
00:48:08,179 --> 00:48:09,858
TRAVIS: Have you been to this town before?

651
00:48:09,858 --> 00:48:14,039
TALIESIN: Not that I can remember. They all look
the same after a while.

652
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:18,344
MATT: You've come through once, but that was a
while back and you weren't really paying

653
00:48:18,344 --> 00:48:19,449
attention.

654
00:48:19,449 --> 00:48:20,648
TALIESIN: Busy, yeah.

655
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:23,280
TRAVIS: And you've never seen conditions like this
affect any other carnival goer before?

656
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,490
TALIESIN: Nothing like this. Hundreds, possibly
thousands of shows. Yeah, thousands of shows.

657
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:32,708
Nothing. Never. It's not us.

658
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:36,014
LAURA: So great! We're stuck in a city that has
zombie issues, that's all.

659
00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:38,398
TRAVIS: Where are the other two?

660
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:40,451
TALIESIN: Which other two?

661
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:44,335
TRAVIS: The stinky one and the little one.

662
00:48:44,335 --> 00:48:46,065
TALIESIN: Oh, your friends!

663
00:48:46,065 --> 00:48:49,938
TRAVIS: Yeah. Can we look around and see if we
spot Caleb and--

664
00:48:49,938 --> 00:48:52,996
TALIESIN: You call them Stinky and the little one?
All right.

665
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:57,143
MATT: You spot around the interior of the tavern.
They don't appear to be nearby.

666
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:58,563
TRAVIS: I wonder if they came back.

667
00:48:58,563 --> 00:49:01,244
LAURA: I'll go up and ask the tavern keeper.

668
00:49:01,244 --> 00:49:02,164
MATT: Okay. Yorda?

669
00:49:02,164 --> 00:49:03,634
LAURA: Yeah, Yorda.

670
00:49:03,634 --> 00:49:09,632
MATT: "Oh, hi! Everything all right? You had a few
bruiser types leading you in here, some of the

671
00:49:09,632 --> 00:49:10,646
"crownsguard, huh?"

672
00:49:10,646 --> 00:49:13,184
LAURA: Oh my gosh, there was this big trouble at
the carnival, did you go?

673
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:15,628
MATT: "I heard about that. I didn't go in there,
but people are coming in here saying--"

674
00:49:15,628 --> 00:49:16,972
LAURA: Somebody turned into a zombie and then--

675
00:49:16,972 --> 00:49:18,077
MATT: "I heard that! That's incredible!"

676
00:49:18,077 --> 00:49:23,126
LAURA: Yeah! And then we're all under
investigation because we saved them! These guards

677
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:32,909
are weird. Hey, did you see the wizard guy, the
stinky guy and the little halfling?

678
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:35,641
MATT: "Yeah, they came in not but a few minutes
before you did. They went upstairs."

679
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:36,771
LAURA: Oh, great! They're here!

680
00:49:36,771 --> 00:49:37,884
TRAVIS: They are?

681
00:49:37,884 --> 00:49:38,706
LAURA: Yeah.

682
00:49:38,706 --> 00:49:40,907
TRAVIS: Good.

683
00:49:40,907 --> 00:49:44,067
MATT: Meanwhile, the two of you are upstairs in
your own chambers.

684
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:48,804
LIAM: During all of that, I would have dragged you
back here, brought you upstairs. And I whip off my

685
00:49:48,804 --> 00:49:54,677
ratty coat, throw it on the bed and sit down on
the ground so that I'm eye level with you, Nott.

686
00:49:54,677 --> 00:49:55,918
SAM: Hi.

687
00:49:55,918 --> 00:50:00,894
LIAM: Nott, you and I have to make some decisions
right now, okay?

688
00:50:00,894 --> 00:50:01,766
SAM: Now?

689
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:02,940
LIAM: Yes.

690
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,438
SAM: Why?

691
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:08,355
LIAM: Well, I know why we said we were coming
here.

692
00:50:08,355 --> 00:50:15,695
SAM: Get some booze, got some books, find a little
taste of civilization, maybe some better food.

693
00:50:15,695 --> 00:50:26,135
LIAM: Yeah. I didn't say, I also had the idea--
you know, you and I meeting and teaming up has

694
00:50:26,135 --> 00:50:28,009
been a good thing.

695
00:50:28,009 --> 00:50:32,514
SAM: Oh, yes, very good. I know everyone else
makes fun of your smell, but I don't smell

696
00:50:32,514 --> 00:50:36,704
nothing.

697
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:45,610
LIAM: That's what I like about you. I have been
thinking, and yesterday just furthers that

698
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:52,722
thinking, that I don't think you and I are enough.
I had the idea that we would come here maybe and

699
00:50:52,722 --> 00:51:00,123
find others that we could tag along with, or meet
up the way you and I did. But now I think that is

700
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:07,646
a terrible idea! The people we spent the day with
are lunatics. I don't think that we can do this.

701
00:51:07,646 --> 00:51:14,193
I've changed my mind entirely, and I think we
should go, but we can't now because we are stuck

702
00:51:14,193 --> 00:51:15,449
here for the moment.

703
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:18,916
SAM: Under sort of holding arrest or something? We
can't leave the city.

704
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:20,179
LIAM: No.

705
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:29,407
SAM: But I was thinking about this. The people we
met down there and spent the day with: they are

706
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:37,925
lunatics, but they draw a lot of attention to
themselves, leaving us free to sort of slink back

707
00:51:37,925 --> 00:51:44,503
into the shadows a little bit. It might be sort of
the perfect camouflage. No one's going to be

708
00:51:44,503 --> 00:51:49,532
looking for a little goblin girl anymore, because
they'll be looking at the crazy people, the

709
00:51:49,532 --> 00:51:54,286
tieflings running around smashing shit.

710
00:51:54,286 --> 00:51:59,773
LIAM: You know, I had not thought of it quite in
that way and that is a good point, but I am not

711
00:51:59,773 --> 00:52:09,146
convinced. I'm not convinced. And perhaps we're
better off-- maybe I was too ambitious.

712
00:52:09,146 --> 00:52:18,474
SAM: Well, let's give it a day and if things seem
a little bit, you know, skinky-doodie tomorrow, we

713
00:52:18,474 --> 00:52:26,431
can fritter away in the middle of the day or
something.

714
00:52:26,431 --> 00:52:37,340
LIAM: All right. Well, we'll wait and see. While
we're here, one thing, okay? No Money Pot. No Rat

715
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:41,864
Food. None of those plays. I have silver, we don't
need it right now.

716
00:52:41,864 --> 00:52:45,938
SAM: But we need to replenish the healing potion
you used. If we don't have that, then what happens

717
00:52:45,938 --> 00:52:48,615
the next you get in trouble?

718
00:52:48,615 --> 00:52:56,467
LIAM: We're sealed here, and they are watching.
We're with a couple of tieflings, a little person

719
00:52:56,467 --> 00:53:02,733
in a doll mask, and a dirty ginger. We've got
people staring at us every second of the day. We

720
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:06,442
need to dial it back a little bit.

721
00:53:06,442 --> 00:53:14,530
SAM: All right, but how on earth are we-- all
right. We can cool it with the cons for a couple

722
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:21,871
of days. But I can't promise that I won't get the
itch again.

723
00:53:21,871 --> 00:53:27,315
LIAM: You just talk to me. You hold Frumpkin. Just
keep your hands full with Frumpkin, okay? Hold my

724
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:28,572
cat, okay?

725
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,702
SAM: All right.

726
00:53:30,702 --> 00:53:34,507
LIAM: And then this is going to blow over because
we didn't do anything! We did something good.

727
00:53:34,507 --> 00:53:36,492
SAM: No! I didn't do nothing, we just went to a
show.

728
00:53:36,492 --> 00:53:37,635
LIAM: That's right.

729
00:53:37,635 --> 00:53:42,831
SAM: It was a pretty good show. Up until, you
know, the dead people part.

730
00:53:42,831 --> 00:53:44,568
LIAM: But it was a good show, wasn't it?

731
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:51,565
SAM: Yeah! Well, we'll lay low. Should we pretend
that we're still friends with these people?

732
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:55,306
LIAM: I was going to suggest the same thing. In
fact, I think we should go downstairs. They're

733
00:53:55,306 --> 00:54:01,862
going to be coming back. We don't want to cause a
stir with them, either. We just want to leave if

734
00:54:01,862 --> 00:54:03,766
that's what we're going to do.

735
00:54:03,766 --> 00:54:08,376
SAM: Don't worry! I'll turn on the charm.

736
00:54:08,376 --> 00:54:09,460
TALIESIN: Thank God.

737
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:15,425
LIAM: Okay. Let's get a drink.

738
00:54:15,425 --> 00:54:18,110
SAM: Thank gods.

739
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:19,900
LIAM: We head downstairs.

740
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,871
MATT: You guys head down. You get to the bottom of
the stairs just in time to see Jester, Beauregard,

741
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:29,396
Molly, and Fjord looking across the tavern, making
their way in your direction, and you guys notice

742
00:54:29,396 --> 00:54:32,190
them meeting you in the tavern room, as well.

743
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:43,358
SAM: Oh, thank God you're here and safe! We missed
you! Somehow we got separated! Friends.

744
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:44,824
LAURA: That happens, yes.

745
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:46,085
MARISHA: Can I insight check him?

746
00:54:46,085 --> 00:54:47,972
MATT: Sure.

747
00:54:47,972 --> 00:54:50,942
SAM and MATT: Her.

748
00:54:50,942 --> 00:54:54,806
MARISHA: Her. Sam. Natural 20.

749
00:54:54,806 --> 00:54:56,309
SAM: I'm lying!

750
00:54:56,309 --> 00:55:01,181
(laughter)

751
00:55:01,181 --> 00:55:06,536
MARISHA: Front butt?! You just saw that, too?!

752
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:11,989
(laughter)

753
00:55:11,989 --> 00:55:17,166
MARISHA: You guys peaced out pretty quickly.

754
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:22,793
LIAM: We did, I did not come to Trostenwald to go
to jail.

755
00:55:22,793 --> 00:55:26,280
TRAVIS: What did you come to Trostenwald for?

756
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:35,585
LIAM: We are tired. We've been traveling a long
time. We've been saving. Wanted to take it easy

757
00:55:35,585 --> 00:55:36,996
for a few days.

758
00:55:36,996 --> 00:55:41,143
TRAVIS: Sure, I'm not trying to pry. I was just
curious where you were going.

759
00:55:41,143 --> 00:55:42,820
MARISHA: Just curious why you have a mask.

760
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:46,005
TALIESIN: If I'm going to listening to somebody's
life story I'm going to need a drink. You,

761
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:47,875
gorgeous, what's your name?

762
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:55,032
MATT: You look over and see a woman with darker
hair, the general barmaid. "Adelaine."

763
00:55:55,032 --> 00:56:00,150
TALIESIN: Adelaine, I would like a round for all
these terrible people and one for myself. What's

764
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:04,237
the difference between these three beers? I've
honestly got to admit, they all taste the same to

765
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:06,722
me.

766
00:56:06,722 --> 00:56:09,311
MATT: "Go with the von Brandt."

767
00:56:09,311 --> 00:56:13,300
TALIESIN: Let's get a round of von Brandt for
everybody.

768
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:18,298
TARVIS: Actually, if it's all the same I'm not
really an ale fan. Do you have any fire whiskey?

769
00:56:18,298 --> 00:56:21,215
MATT: "We can get you some liquor, aye."

770
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:22,250
LAURA: Can I have some milk?

771
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,413
SAM: Two, please.

772
00:56:24,413 --> 00:56:29,172
MATT: "All right." She walks away.

773
00:56:29,172 --> 00:56:32,547
LAURA: You think she heard that I wanted milk?

774
00:56:32,547 --> 00:56:35,898
TALIESIN: I don't know. I'm going to ask for one
of each of these beers because I want to have a

775
00:56:35,898 --> 00:56:39,534
tasting competition. I'm not going to be drinking
alone.

776
00:56:39,534 --> 00:56:43,266
LIAM: I wander away from these two with their
questions and I sit down with Molly.

777
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:45,603
LAURA: Caleb, you want to see something cool?

778
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:47,438
LIAM: I would love to see something cool.

779
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:51,637
LAURA: I show Caleb where I etched the dick in the
table a couple nights ago.

780
00:56:51,637 --> 00:56:55,280
MARISHA: Yeah! Bringing it back.

781
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,577
LIAM: That's pretty good.

782
00:56:56,577 --> 00:56:58,400
TALIESIN: How'd you etch a deck in the table?

783
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,639
LAURA: It's a dick.

784
00:56:59,639 --> 00:57:01,125
TALIESIN: Oh.

785
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:03,657
LIAM: Have you always been an artist?

786
00:57:03,657 --> 00:57:06,563
LAURA: I have actually, I've been an artist since
I was little.

787
00:57:06,563 --> 00:57:08,643
TALIESIN: You think that's what they look like?

788
00:57:08,643 --> 00:57:13,436
LAURA: I've seen a lot of dicks. That is what most
of them look like.

789
00:57:13,436 --> 00:57:16,617
TALIESIN: I'm already in my cups.

790
00:57:16,617 --> 00:57:20,059
LAURA: What?

791
00:57:20,059 --> 00:57:23,878
LIAM: So where do you two come from?

792
00:57:23,878 --> 00:57:25,380
LAURA: Us two?

793
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,237
LIAM: Yes, you two with the horns.

794
00:57:27,237 --> 00:57:30,793
LAURA: Well, I don't know where he comes from. You
think we all come from the same place? That was

795
00:57:30,793 --> 00:57:34,860
really inconsiderate.

796
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,565
LIAM: No, you are very different it's very clear.

797
00:57:36,565 --> 00:57:37,817
LAURA: He's purple.

798
00:57:37,817 --> 00:57:39,771
TALIESIN: She's blue.

799
00:57:39,771 --> 00:57:41,525
LAURA: Which is pretty rare.

800
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:43,164
LIAM: He's every color.

801
00:57:43,164 --> 00:57:49,222
TALIESIN: It's very true.

802
00:57:49,222 --> 00:57:55,583
LAURA: I'm from Nicodranas.

803
00:57:55,583 --> 00:58:01,219
LIAM: Remember when we started the first campaign
and all those places came in a split second and

804
00:58:01,219 --> 00:58:15,373
all that history. I'm from Shrev`nam Chicago. Oh
yes.

805
00:58:15,373 --> 00:58:18,972
TALIESIN: I'm from the circus.

806
00:58:18,972 --> 00:58:20,972
LIAM: So you're a traveler then?

807
00:58:20,972 --> 00:58:23,393
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Quite a while.

808
00:58:23,393 --> 00:58:26,329
LIAM: Since childhood?

809
00:58:26,329 --> 00:58:34,628
TALIESIN: Long as I can reasonably remember at the
very least. It's been a while. It's nice. I like

810
00:58:34,628 --> 00:58:37,420
it. They're good people. Work hard.

811
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,347
LIAM: You have a lot of scars.

812
00:58:40,347 --> 00:58:43,463
TALIESIN: That's a very funny story, actually.

813
00:58:43,463 --> 00:58:45,159
TRAVIS: I like funny stories.

814
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:49,704
TALIESIN: Me too.

815
00:58:49,704 --> 00:58:53,202
TRAVIS: You did some crazy shit with that sword of
yours.

816
00:58:53,202 --> 00:59:03,048
TALIESIN: Thank you. These swords-- you buy a
drink and we'll see.

817
00:59:03,048 --> 00:59:10,007
TRAVIS: You polish off that one already?

818
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:14,887
LAURA: Wow, that's a lot-- okay.

819
00:59:14,887 --> 00:59:17,730
TRAVIS: Can we get another round? For the--

820
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:20,125
TALIESIN: How much I owe you for the first round?

821
00:59:20,125 --> 00:59:22,248
MATT: They are keeping a tally of the table.

822
00:59:22,248 --> 00:59:26,889
LIAM: Frumpkin scrabbles up onto Nott's shoulder.

823
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:30,791
SAM: Hi Frumpy, nice to see you again.

824
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:34,094
TALIESIN: Mother always told me to never give a
story away for free.

825
00:59:34,094 --> 00:59:35,393
TRAVIS: Wise words.

826
00:59:35,393 --> 00:59:38,041
LAURA: My mother said don't give away other things
for free.

827
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,679
TALIESIN: I already like your mother.

828
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:43,353
MARISHA: My mother always said nothing in life is
free.

829
00:59:43,353 --> 00:59:45,666
TALIESIN: I can tell.

830
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:54,661
MARISHA: None of this absolves the dodgy goblin
who slinked past that first question. Where are

831
00:59:54,661 --> 00:59:57,751
you from? What are you traveling from? Why the
mask?

832
00:59:57,751 --> 01:00:01,664
TRAVIS: Only because we seem to find ourselves in
quite the predicament.

833
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:07,824
SAM: We're just a couple of friends, strolling
around the countryside looking for adventure.

834
01:00:07,824 --> 01:00:10,032
MARISHA: Sure you are.

835
01:00:10,032 --> 01:00:15,132
LIAM: Do you see many goblins walking around
cities here?

836
01:00:15,132 --> 01:00:21,092
MARISHA: It has nothing to do with that. People
who move from place to place frequently tend to

837
01:00:21,092 --> 01:00:23,976
have other stories as to why they're doing it.

838
01:00:23,976 --> 01:00:28,460
LIAM: Well, let me make it clear: goblins are not
typically welcome in any cities, that is why the

839
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:29,670
mask.

840
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:36,233
MARISHA: Well, you're going back to the goblin
thing. I'm more curious about the travel thing.

841
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:45,510
SAM: We have a string of bad luck. We tend to get
in trouble in places for various reasons. Some of

842
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:50,271
which is my fault. Most of which is my fault. I
have sticky fingers. I can't help myself

843
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:58,972
sometimes. I'm fascinated by little bobbles and
fancy pieces of jewelries and I love trinkets so

844
01:00:58,972 --> 01:01:08,134
much! I just have to take them, and have them
with me, and put them in my pockets. It's gotten

845
01:01:08,134 --> 01:01:18,331
us in a few scrapes a couple times. Caleb, he is
fantastic. Very patient with me, understands. But

846
01:01:18,331 --> 01:01:27,483
really it's my fault; it's not him. He's a smart
man, a brilliant magician! Have you seen? Some of

847
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:29,981
his tricks are phenomenal, really.

848
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:31,490
TRAVIS: No, I'd love to.

849
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:37,175
SAM: I feel bad to because we never stay in one
place long enough for him to have a decent shower.

850
01:01:37,175 --> 01:01:42,146
(laughter)

851
01:01:42,146 --> 01:01:44,909
TRAVIS: It's a moving story.

852
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:51,085
MARISHA: I immediately check my pockets after that
to see is Nott has lifted anything. Is everything

853
01:01:51,085 --> 01:01:52,702
still there, all my coin?

854
01:01:52,702 --> 01:01:54,018
MATT: Make an investigation check.

855
01:01:54,018 --> 01:01:57,255
TALIESIN: I'm going to join you on this one.

856
01:01:57,255 --> 01:02:02,378
MARISHA: Not great. Not great at all. Six.

857
01:02:02,378 --> 01:02:04,028
TALIESIN: 16.

858
01:02:04,028 --> 01:02:07,697
MATT: 16? Everything seems to be in order for
you.

859
01:02:07,697 --> 01:02:12,860
MARISHA: Wait that was a 15! Right? That was the
dice I rolled? 16.

860
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:15,335
MATT: Everything seems to be in order.

861
01:02:15,335 --> 01:02:18,460
MARISHA: Okay.

862
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:22,454
SAM: Anyway, that's the long and short of it.

863
01:02:22,454 --> 01:02:25,335
LAURA: What do you do with the things once you
steal them?

864
01:02:25,335 --> 01:02:28,338
SAM: Well the nice ones I keep. I have a little--

865
01:02:28,338 --> 01:02:30,067
LAURA: Do you have a collection?

866
01:02:30,067 --> 01:02:38,918
SAM: I collect a lot of things, but in the last
place we hunkered down, it was all taken from me.

867
01:02:38,918 --> 01:02:46,586
We were in one of those prisons before-- Am I
sharing too much? I'm sharing too much, aren't I?

868
01:02:46,586 --> 01:02:52,465
We were in a prison, they took all of our
belongings. I lost all of my collections. I had a

869
01:02:52,465 --> 01:03:00,177
lovely rock collection. I had a rare coin
collection. I had a stick collection. Yeah, it's

870
01:03:00,177 --> 01:03:02,206
all gone now.

871
01:03:02,206 --> 01:03:04,380
LAURA: What about shiny things, though?

872
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,789
SAM: I love them. I just don't have any right
now.

873
01:03:06,789 --> 01:03:10,538
LAURA: Because I think if you have sticky fingers
for sticks and rocks, I don't think that will get

874
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:12,353
you in trouble.

875
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:17,150
SAM: True. But they were like people's canes and
things.

876
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:26,724
(laughter)

877
01:03:26,724 --> 01:03:32,474
SAM: I mean I call them sticks because I don't
need them. But I suppose they really needed them.

878
01:03:32,474 --> 01:03:34,269
LAURA: Yeah, that makes sense.

879
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:38,117
TALIESIN: There's only one way to find out.

880
01:03:38,117 --> 01:03:45,768
MARISHA: Wait, I'm sorry. I think I need
clarification. If sticks mean things like valuable

881
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:49,414
canes, what do rocks mean to you?

882
01:03:49,414 --> 01:03:55,804
SAM: You know those rocks that humans wear on
their fingers and around their necks and stuff.

883
01:03:55,804 --> 01:03:58,509
They're really nice rocks.

884
01:03:58,509 --> 01:04:01,440
LIAM: We don't have many of those at the moment.

885
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,735
TRAVIS: Would it be fair to say that the more
someone desires something, the more you're

886
01:04:05,735 --> 01:04:08,844
interest increases?

887
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:21,001
SAM: Oh I don't care about the people who have
them. I just like pretty things. Toys, anything

888
01:04:21,001 --> 01:04:22,342
really.

889
01:04:22,342 --> 01:04:25,112
LAURA: I'll keep an eye out for things that you
would like.

890
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:27,728
SAM: Okay! Can you help with that?

891
01:04:27,728 --> 01:04:32,052
LAURA: I can if you want me to. Or I can point it
out.

892
01:04:32,052 --> 01:04:37,083
MARISHA: Is it the joy of taking the things or do
you just like gifts?

893
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:39,998
SAM: No, it's the collecting.

894
01:04:39,998 --> 01:04:45,773
LIAM: It's like a nervous tick a little bit.

895
01:04:45,773 --> 01:04:49,389
TRAVIS: Are you good at it? Do you get caught very
often?

896
01:04:49,389 --> 01:04:52,561
SAM: Well, would you like a demonstration?

897
01:04:52,561 --> 01:04:54,623
LAURA: Yes!

898
01:04:54,623 --> 01:04:59,070
TRAVIS: Now, Jester, if I may, we are already in a
little bit of a pickle.

899
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:03,539
LAURA: Steal something from me! Do you want me to
close my eyes?

900
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:12,751
SAM: Sure! That'll make it really easy. Are they
closed?

901
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:16,389
LAURA: Yeah.

902
01:05:16,389 --> 01:05:28,235
SAM: All right. Out of practice here. I'm going to
do a shot. Crack my knuckles.

903
01:05:28,235 --> 01:05:32,045
LAURA: Just don't take the thing on my waist,
because he'll be pissed.

904
01:05:32,045 --> 01:05:35,242
SAM: He'll be pissed? What?

905
01:05:35,242 --> 01:05:36,697
LAURA: Yeah.

906
01:05:36,697 --> 01:05:37,762
SAM: He?

907
01:05:37,762 --> 01:05:38,713
LAURA: Yeah.

908
01:05:38,713 --> 01:05:40,014
SAM: What's on your waist?

909
01:05:40,014 --> 01:05:41,980
TALIESIN: I'm looking at her waist. What's on her
waist?

910
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,467
MATT: What's on your waist?

911
01:05:43,467 --> 01:05:45,561
LAURA: My symbol to the Traveler.

912
01:05:45,561 --> 01:05:51,847
SAM: Oh. All right, I'll go to her left buttcheek
pocket and fish around.

913
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:58,864
LAURA: I'm in a dress. I don't have a pocket on my
buttcheek. But you can try.

914
01:05:58,864 --> 01:06:03,161
SAM: What pockets do you have?

915
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:09,458
LAURA: I would have pockets on the front of my
dress, and maybe a little pouch on my hip.

916
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:11,224
SAM: I'll do the hip pocket.

917
01:06:11,224 --> 01:06:14,182
MATT: All right, make a sleight of hand check.

918
01:06:14,182 --> 01:06:15,639
SAM: Three.

919
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:18,976
(laughter)

920
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:21,903
MATT: You close your eyes and feel a tug and a
shake--

921
01:06:21,903 --> 01:06:24,744
SAM: Plus eight.

922
01:06:24,744 --> 01:06:27,070
MATT: What's your passive perception?

923
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:29,121
TALIESIN: I'm going to guess ten.

924
01:06:29,121 --> 01:06:30,742
LAURA: No, it's 13.

925
01:06:30,742 --> 01:06:32,974
MATT: So, yeah, you totally feel--

926
01:06:32,974 --> 01:06:37,382
LAURA: You're doing great!

927
01:06:37,382 --> 01:06:46,961
SAM: This is not how it usually works! The person
is not really expecting it. This is embarrassing,

928
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:51,222
really. I have the one skill and I failed at it.

929
01:06:51,222 --> 01:06:54,534
LAURA: It's okay, you can keep practicing.

930
01:06:54,534 --> 01:06:58,090
LIAM: There is that one magic trick that you're
able to do. Would you like to show them the magic

931
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:06,438
trick that you can do? I pull out a small red clay
ceramic bowl. Then I pull out a copper piece.

932
01:07:06,438 --> 01:07:10,197
Here, you know the trick, right?

933
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:14,255
SAM: Yes, I know the trick. Takes a little bit of
time, doesn't it?

934
01:07:14,255 --> 01:07:15,737
LIAM: You're good.

935
01:07:15,737 --> 01:07:22,983
SAM: Okay. (clears throat) I do know one piece of
magic. Feast your eyes--

936
01:07:22,983 --> 01:07:25,989
TRAVIS: I take one step back.

937
01:07:25,989 --> 01:07:36,293
on the sacred money pot of school. 
If you place a copper piece into this pot

938
01:07:36,293 --> 01:07:39,644
and say the magic words-- 
what's the magic word again?

939
01:07:39,644 --> 01:07:41,168
LIAM: Fibulous.

940
01:07:41,168 --> 01:07:45,447
SAM: Fibulous! It will turn into a silver piece.

941
01:07:45,447 --> 01:07:48,494
LAURA: Should I say it?

942
01:07:48,494 --> 01:07:50,177
TALIESIN: I want to hear you say it, anyway.

943
01:07:50,177 --> 01:07:51,858
SAM: Only I can say it.

944
01:07:51,858 --> 01:07:57,137
(laughter)

945
01:07:57,137 --> 01:08:03,342
SAM: For everyone has their own magic word, and it
won't work with you.

946
01:08:03,342 --> 01:08:10,240
(vocalizing, trills)

947
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:16,975
By the ancient order of the school, fibulous!

948
01:08:16,975 --> 01:08:20,568
LIAM: That is a silver coin right there.

949
01:08:20,568 --> 01:08:29,813
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Wait a minute. Does this mean
the silver I won from you was actually copper?

950
01:08:29,813 --> 01:08:32,012
SAM: No, it only works up.

951
01:08:32,012 --> 01:08:34,810
LAURA: Great! Thanks for the silver.

952
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:41,166
SAM: Well, no, we weren't giving you the silver
piece just showing you a bit of magic. This pot is

953
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:46,029
actually quite powerful. It can do that once a
day, so if you'd like to purchase it.

954
01:08:46,029 --> 01:08:48,878
LAURA: Can you turn this into a gold piece?

955
01:08:48,878 --> 01:08:51,237
SAM: Well, it only works once a day.

956
01:08:51,237 --> 01:08:54,533
LAURA: Well, tomorrow can you make it gold?

957
01:08:54,533 --> 01:08:58,484
SAM: I think it only does the copper to silver?

958
01:08:58,484 --> 01:09:01,826
LIAM: The magic is not that strong.

959
01:09:01,826 --> 01:09:08,929
SAM: Yes, it's a mild magic pot. But if you'd like
to purchase it from us, we can sell it to you for

960
01:09:08,929 --> 01:09:11,213
five gold.

961
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:15,404
LAURA: Five gold for one silver a day? That
doesn't add up.

962
01:09:15,404 --> 01:09:17,529
TRAVIS: By the end of the week you made your money
back.

963
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:22,207
LAURA: No.

964
01:09:22,207 --> 01:09:25,671
SAM: At discount for friends, three gold.

965
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:29,246
LAURA: Three gold.

966
01:09:29,246 --> 01:09:32,993
SAM: And for that, we'll teach you your own magic
word.

967
01:09:32,993 --> 01:09:35,573
LAURA: That's pretty good.

968
01:09:35,573 --> 01:09:37,989
TALIESIN: That's 40 days.

969
01:09:37,989 --> 01:09:39,467
LAURA: 40 days?

970
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:42,376
SAM: You can do it once a day forever, you have it
for the rest of your life.

971
01:09:42,376 --> 01:09:45,020
LAURA: Yeah, but I have lots of money. I don't
need it.

972
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:47,807
SAM: But this is free money, that you don't have
to work for.

973
01:09:47,807 --> 01:09:52,886
LIAM: Also, you know, they basically helped us out
today. You can do it for one, for them.

974
01:09:52,886 --> 01:09:55,162
SAM: All right, one gold.

975
01:09:55,162 --> 01:10:05,359
LAURA: One gold. That's a really good deal. Did
you hear how much he gave me a deal? Okay!

976
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:07,216
MATT: Do you give him the gold?

977
01:10:07,216 --> 01:10:12,646
LAURA: Yes, I'll give him the gold. Hold on, let
me make sure I have it. Where's my--?

978
01:10:12,646 --> 01:10:14,371
TALIESIN: It's the second button.

979
01:10:14,371 --> 01:10:19,761
LAURA: Oh, currency! Gold. Okay, one down.

980
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:23,345
MARISHA: Do I notice anything shifty about that,
while we were looking at his hands?

981
01:10:23,345 --> 01:10:25,934
MATT: Perception check.

982
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:27,975
LAURA: What's my magic word?

983
01:10:27,975 --> 01:10:31,001
LIAM: It can be whatever you want it to be. You
have to agree upon it and you have to focus on

984
01:10:31,001 --> 01:10:34,350
that word for one full day while you are in
possession of the pot.

985
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:35,390
MARISHA: 21.

986
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:40,222
MATT: You watch that copper piece become silver,
magically.

987
01:10:40,222 --> 01:10:43,845
LAURA: How about skinky doodie?

988
01:10:43,845 --> 01:10:49,921
LIAM: Skinky doodie, that is unique. I'm sure no
one else has possession of that arcane power word.

989
01:10:49,921 --> 01:10:55,104
I could consider it yours if you focused on it all
day tomorrow. But you really have to focus.

990
01:10:55,104 --> 01:11:05,170
LAURA: Okay, I will. Super a lot of focus. Skinky
doodie. Thank you for this.

991
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:10,765
SAM: It's a pleasure doing business with you. Does
that answer your question? I've got some for you.

992
01:11:10,765 --> 01:11:13,981
MARISHA: You have questions for me?

993
01:11:13,981 --> 01:11:21,318
SAM: Yeah! How does someone like you -- you're
human right?

994
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:22,711
MARISHA: Yeah, I am.

995
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:26,649
SAM: How do you come by learning Halfling?

996
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:36,697
MARISHA: My parents were in the winery business.
The wine making business. And halflings really

997
01:11:36,697 --> 01:11:38,704
like wine.

998
01:11:38,704 --> 01:11:40,793
SAM: Everyone likes wine!

999
01:11:40,793 --> 01:11:42,810
MARISHA: That's true.

1000
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:45,143
TRAVIS: Some people more than others.

1001
01:11:45,143 --> 01:11:52,122
MARISHA: Some halflings just deal in wine a lot,
and a lot did in the town that I'm from and then

1002
01:11:52,122 --> 01:11:56,502
my parents wanted me to keep up with the books and
all that stuff so it forced me to learn halfling.

1003
01:11:56,502 --> 01:11:58,225
I was around it a lot.

1004
01:11:58,225 --> 01:12:00,604
SAM: What town was that then?

1005
01:12:00,604 --> 01:12:03,734
LAURA: It's close by here, right?

1006
01:12:03,734 --> 01:12:07,896
MARISHA: It's a bit aways. It's Kamordah.

1007
01:12:07,896 --> 01:12:10,033
SAM: Hmm, haven't heard of it.

1008
01:12:10,033 --> 01:12:16,185
MARISHA: It's a small farming town, it's no big
deal. It's whatever.

1009
01:12:16,185 --> 01:12:19,873
SAM: Nothing shady there!

1010
01:12:19,873 --> 01:12:25,849
MARISHA: Nope, just a wandering traveler just like
the rest of y'all.

1011
01:12:25,849 --> 01:12:29,435
TRAVIS: Well I mean I was really impressed with
the little trick, I sure would like to see a big

1012
01:12:29,435 --> 01:12:30,960
trick.

1013
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:37,270
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to open all the windows!

1014
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:41,630
MATT: Being about one o'clock in the morning at
this time, and the energy in the tavern has come

1015
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:45,981
to a quiet crawl, those who are keeping their cups
are either snoring or in the process of preparing

1016
01:12:45,981 --> 01:12:52,939
to go to sleep, you watch as Adelaine, the
barmaid is walking around cleaning up tables and

1017
01:12:52,939 --> 01:12:59,323
suddenly all the windows in the room slam open
with a heavy impact and there's a burst of wind

1018
01:12:59,323 --> 01:13:05,591
that comes through. The two crownsguard that were
outside flanking the opening doorway suddenly rush

1019
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:09,391
and look in and look about at the lot of you.

1020
01:13:09,391 --> 01:13:15,630
TALIESIN: Sorry! Drinking! I did order two extra.
Two extra?

1021
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:18,568
MATT: They both just slowly curl back to their
perimeter.

1022
01:13:18,568 --> 01:13:20,233
TALIESIN: You're no fun.

1023
01:13:20,233 --> 01:13:27,645
MARISHA: Yeah, circus! Woo, circus coming to
town!

1024
01:13:27,645 --> 01:13:30,833
TRAVIS: Jester, I meant a trick from Caleb.

1025
01:13:30,833 --> 01:13:34,333
LAURA: Oh.

1026
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:36,177
LIAM: You want to see a trick?

1027
01:13:36,177 --> 01:13:38,393
TRAVIS: I would love one.

1028
01:13:38,393 --> 01:13:46,015
LIAM: I am well into my second trost at this
point. I can show you a trick. Young lady, if you

1029
01:13:46,015 --> 01:13:48,832
would assist me please. Step up onto the table.

1030
01:13:48,832 --> 01:13:50,457
SAM: Absolutely!

1031
01:13:50,457 --> 01:13:52,524
MARISHA: Just don't break anything.

1032
01:13:52,524 --> 01:14:02,850
LIAM: Adjust your minds. I begin to weave one hand
in a slow circle around the other, and a globe of

1033
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:05,430
golden light poofs out.

1034
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:12,658
SAM: I put my hands and feet out in an akimbo
pose.

1035
01:14:12,658 --> 01:14:15,667
LIAM: A second little globule of light comes out.

1036
01:14:15,667 --> 01:14:18,858
SAM: I feel it coming! Hit me!

1037
01:14:18,858 --> 01:14:26,279
LIAM: Then two more at the same time come out of
my hand. Then they amass upon my little companion

1038
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:36,475
and form a similar sized little humanoid of light
that then coincides with my little friend. She is

1039
01:14:36,475 --> 01:14:40,511
glowing golden on a table in the middle of the
Nestled Nook.

1040
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:44,560
SAM: (sings)

1041
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:47,500
LIAM: The Goblight, ladies and gentlemen. The
Goblight!

1042
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,417
SAM: Thank you!

1043
01:14:49,417 --> 01:14:54,595
MATT: There's some claps in the back rooms. You
see one of the drunken gentlemen has come to

1044
01:14:54,595 --> 01:14:58,550
semi-consciousness and goes, "That's impressive!"
(&lt;i>hic&lt;/i>)

1045
01:14:58,550 --> 01:15:00,989
Then passes back out on the table.

1046
01:15:00,989 --> 01:15:04,371
TRAVIS: How did you learn to do that?

1047
01:15:04,371 --> 01:15:15,911
LIAM: I could always do that a little bit, as a
kid. I was always good with magic. I had a knack

1048
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:18,548
for it. That one's easy.

1049
01:15:18,548 --> 01:15:21,314
TRAVIS: That's impressive.

1050
01:15:21,314 --> 01:15:25,146
LIAM: Well, thank you.

1051
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,601
MARISHA: Aw buddy.

1052
01:15:27,601 --> 01:15:30,351
LAURA: Maybe he can teach you how to do that.

1053
01:15:30,351 --> 01:15:34,091
TRAVIS: Is it something that can be taught to
others?

1054
01:15:34,091 --> 01:15:37,020
TALIESIN: Are you trying to learn magic? Is that a
thing?

1055
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:43,202
TRAVIS: Well, I'm just a little curious about
how people use their magic.

1056
01:15:43,202 --> 01:15:49,996
MARISHA: I've seen you have a few tricks up your
sleeve. You seem like you're not totally magic inept.

1057
01:15:49,996 --> 01:15:56,693
TRAVIS: No, it's relatively new for me though, so
I'm just trying to learn.

1058
01:15:56,693 --> 01:15:58,902
LIAM: Are you reading a lot?

1059
01:15:58,902 --> 01:16:02,912
TRAVIS: No, I wonder if maybe I should be?

1060
01:16:02,912 --> 01:16:12,051
LIAM: Well, it could be helpful. Although, I'm a
bit of an amateur teacher. I taught Nott the one

1061
01:16:12,051 --> 01:16:15,849
trick you saw, but other things. We've been
working together, I suppose I could try to help

1062
01:16:15,849 --> 01:16:17,405
you.

1063
01:16:17,405 --> 01:16:21,841
MARISHA: Have you had your abilities your whole
life, like a kid?

1064
01:16:21,841 --> 01:16:27,920
TRAVIS: No. Again, fairly recently.

1065
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,061
MARISHA: Something happen?

1066
01:16:31,061 --> 01:16:34,408
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1067
01:16:34,408 --> 01:16:40,363
LIAM: Oh, I'm sorry, do you two not know each
other super well? You seem like you do.

1068
01:16:40,363 --> 01:16:44,353
MARISHA: We got a good 24-48 hours on the rest of
you.

1069
01:16:44,353 --> 01:16:46,332
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're not super deep.

1070
01:16:46,332 --> 01:16:49,119
MARISHA: Nope.

1071
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:52,475
SAM: Where did you come from then?

1072
01:16:52,475 --> 01:16:56,301
TRAVIS: Well I came up from the town of Port
Damali.

1073
01:16:56,301 --> 01:16:58,167
LAURA: That's where we met!

1074
01:16:58,167 --> 01:17:05,091
TRAVIS: Yeah, I met Jester a while back and after I
Ieft town, coming up to the northeast, I ran

1075
01:17:05,091 --> 01:17:10,916
across her. I'd seen her do some of her magic
before. That's what I'm trying to learn about.

1076
01:17:10,916 --> 01:17:15,131
LAURA: If you need anymore displays, you just let
me know.

1077
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:18,394
LIAM: We've seen that window thing a couple times.
It's good.

1078
01:17:18,394 --> 01:17:28,188
MARISHA: Can I request a display? I think I have a
broken rib. It might be getting more purple.

1079
01:17:28,188 --> 01:17:32,764
LAURA: Oh yeah, I mean I can ask, but I think I'm
tapped.

1080
01:17:32,764 --> 01:17:37,019
MARISHA: I'll sleep it off, it's fine.

1081
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:54,606
LAURA: Yeah. I can try! I'll put my hand out. I'll
try to cast Cure Wounds. I got shit. I got

1082
01:17:54,606 --> 01:17:58,170
nothing. It's not happening.

1083
01:17:58,170 --> 01:17:59,909
SAM: It's past midnight!

1084
01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:02,274
LAURA: Oh, no. I've got to sleep.

1085
01:18:02,274 --> 01:18:05,207
MATT: You concentrate for a moment. Make a
medicine check.

1086
01:18:05,207 --> 01:18:09,466
LAURA: Okay!

1087
01:18:09,466 --> 01:18:12,369
SAM: Natural 12!

1088
01:18:12,369 --> 01:18:14,636
LAURA: That's 17.

1089
01:18:14,636 --> 01:18:23,992
MATT: 17. You focus on the bruised area, exposed
out of her monk robes. You watch as the slight

1090
01:18:23,992 --> 01:18:27,823
bruising suddenly turns like a sickly green.

1091
01:18:27,823 --> 01:18:29,481
SAM: Is that good?

1092
01:18:29,481 --> 01:18:34,699
MATT: In a very unhealthy way.

1093
01:18:34,699 --> 01:18:45,121
LAURA: You know what? I think this might be worse
than just like a bruised rib. Can I poke it? Does

1094
01:18:45,121 --> 01:18:47,274
it seem infected?

1095
01:18:47,274 --> 01:18:48,545
MARISHA: Does it hurt?

1096
01:18:48,545 --> 01:18:52,786
LAURA: I'm not going to poke it with my finger,
though, I'm going to poke at it with a fork.

1097
01:18:52,786 --> 01:18:57,155
MARISHA: Don't poke at me with a fork!

1098
01:18:57,155 --> 01:19:03,694
MATT: Right now, she's inspecting it. You take a
fork off the table and poke.

1099
01:19:03,694 --> 01:19:05,314
MARISHA: No, you don't!

1100
01:19:05,314 --> 01:19:09,752
LAURA: I'll use the blunt end, don't be such a
baby!

1101
01:19:09,752 --> 01:19:16,162
MATT: She pushes it in and the bruise hurts a bit.
You watch as this sickly pus liquid begins to pour

1102
01:19:16,162 --> 01:19:23,492
out, with a thick viscosity and a lot of it. You
all of the sudden feel like you've punctured a

1103
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:28,356
balloon that's beginning to erupt and you feel
awful. Then you blink a few times and it's just a

1104
01:19:28,356 --> 01:19:33,590
bruise. You hear this distant (cackling).

1105
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:36,548
LAURA: Oh, motherfucker, he's such a dick!

1106
01:19:36,548 --> 01:19:40,402
SAM: What? Who? What? What's going on?

1107
01:19:40,402 --> 01:19:44,046
MARISHA: My bruise is in the shape of a dick?

1108
01:19:44,046 --> 01:19:45,814
LAURA: That would be really cool.

1109
01:19:45,814 --> 01:19:48,307
MARISHA: That would be fun!

1110
01:19:48,307 --> 01:19:53,850
LAURA: I'm just going make sure, I'm going to push
on it a bit more. I think it's okay, you're fine.

1111
01:19:53,850 --> 01:19:56,831
MARISHA: All right. I'll sleep it off.

1112
01:19:56,831 --> 01:19:59,813
LAURA: I think I need some sleep, you guys.

1113
01:19:59,813 --> 01:20:04,927
LIAM: Gustav, the person who runs the circus, is
he your friend?

1114
01:20:04,927 --> 01:20:06,001
TALIESIN: He's family.

1115
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:07,320
LIAM: He's family?

1116
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,520
TALIESIN: We take care of each other. He's a good
man.

1117
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,493
LIAM: So what's your play tomorrow?

1118
01:20:12,493 --> 01:20:19,043
TALIESIN: Well, they have all my things and they
have all my family. I'm going to figure out what is

1119
01:20:19,043 --> 01:20:26,110
going on. Try and find out what's actually doing
this. I assume since it's none of us, it's going

1120
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:27,931
to happen again.

1121
01:20:27,931 --> 01:20:31,019
LAURA: But how can we because we can't leave this
tavern?

1122
01:20:31,019 --> 01:20:35,585
TALIESIN: Well, I--

1123
01:20:35,585 --> 01:20:40,375
SAM: Were Caleb and I not instructed not to leave
the tavern? We received no formal instruction.

1124
01:20:40,375 --> 01:20:42,684
MATT: No, you weren't part of that formal
instruction. The rest of you were told not to

1125
01:20:42,684 --> 01:20:44,305
leave the tavern until further notice.

1126
01:20:44,305 --> 01:20:46,537
TALIESIN: I'm sure if we sleep on it, we'll think
of something.

1127
01:20:46,537 --> 01:20:51,904
LAURA: Fjord! You and I could leave in the morning
the same way we got in.

1128
01:20:51,904 --> 01:20:53,456
TRAVIS: That's true.

1129
01:20:53,456 --> 01:20:54,899
SAM: How'd you get in?

1130
01:20:54,899 --> 01:21:00,391
LAURA: With magic. I would show you now, but I'm
out of spells!

1131
01:21:00,391 --> 01:21:03,439
SAM: The fork trick wasn't very fun, was it?

1132
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:08,139
LAURA: No. I was making sure she wasn't a zombie.
I thought she might be.

1133
01:21:08,139 --> 01:21:10,180
TALIESIN: That's fair.

1134
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,411
LAURA: She got clawed, right?

1135
01:21:11,411 --> 01:21:12,935
TALIESIN: A bit, yeah.

1136
01:21:12,935 --> 01:21:17,597
LAURA: All right. Hey bitches, I'm going to go to
bed.

1137
01:21:17,597 --> 01:21:26,820
TALIESIN: Where exactly am I going to be sleeping,
by the way? I can sleep down here, but it might be nice--

1138
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:30,323
TRAVIS: Molly, if you would like to share my room,
you can.

1139
01:21:30,323 --> 01:21:37,384
TALIESIN: Excellent. You don't mind? I'm going to
pull the swords off finally and start getting

1140
01:21:37,384 --> 01:21:41,292
comfortable out of the performance clothes.

1141
01:21:41,292 --> 01:21:47,381
MARISHA: I'm in Jester's room, still, I think.
Sleeping on the floor on my bedroll.

1142
01:21:47,381 --> 01:21:54,661
LAURA: As she starts to go to sleep, I want to
draw in my sketchbook and tell the Traveler all

1143
01:21:54,661 --> 01:22:01,493
about the cool things I saw for the day. I'm going
to draw the red faced guard as I pretended I was a

1144
01:22:01,493 --> 01:22:11,744
zombie, and I'm going to draw Molly's horns all
full of jewels and stuff! I'm going to draw the

1145
01:22:11,744 --> 01:22:14,323
stack of books.

1146
01:22:14,323 --> 01:22:17,065
SAM: The monster attack?

1147
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:24,430
LAURA: And I'm going to draw like a zombie, but
like as an old man but as he's biting his dentures

1148
01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:28,533
fall out and he's not no teeth!

1149
01:22:28,533 --> 01:22:32,921
MATT: All righty. Fairly decent sketches,
actually. You eventually find yourself to sleep.

1150
01:22:32,921 --> 01:22:41,157
The rest of you, go to your respective rooms and
find yourselves falling into a night's rest. As

1151
01:22:41,157 --> 01:22:45,480
evening comes to a close and the morning brings
you to consciousness, you are rested. You are

1152
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,248
healed up, your spells are restored.

1153
01:22:48,248 --> 01:22:51,626
SAM: I can use the Long Rest feature of D&D
Beyond!

1154
01:22:51,626 --> 01:22:55,148
MARISHA: You hit a button!

1155
01:22:55,148 --> 01:22:56,456
LAURA: And all my spells back!

1156
01:22:56,456 --> 01:22:57,731
TALIESIN: There is a button for it.

1157
01:22:57,731 --> 01:23:08,250
SAM: Whoa, nothing changed! No spells. I lost ten
hit points?! What the fuck?! I've done something

1158
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,682
terribly wrong.

1159
01:23:09,682 --> 01:23:11,537
(laughter)

1160
01:23:11,537 --> 01:23:15,970
TRAVIS: D&D Beyond's watching going, "Fuck you,
Nott!"

1161
01:23:15,970 --> 01:23:19,782
LAURA: Wait no, you're putting temporary hit
points on! What are you doing?

1162
01:23:19,782 --> 01:23:23,173
SAM: We'll work on this during the break.

1163
01:23:23,173 --> 01:23:27,215
LIAM: Self destruct in 10, nine.

1164
01:23:27,215 --> 01:23:29,564
MARISHA: He just throws the iPad.

1165
01:23:29,564 --> 01:23:34,476
MATT: Coming to consciousness in your respective
rooms, cold morning air. It's a bit frosty. The

1166
01:23:34,476 --> 01:23:42,774
windows to each of your rooms have a bit of that
curled bit of frost on the outskirts of the glass.

1167
01:23:42,774 --> 01:23:47,739
It's probably 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning at this
point in time and the day is yours. What do you

1168
01:23:47,739 --> 01:23:48,930
wish to do?

1169
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:52,514
MARISHA: As I wake up, I sit up and I go: Jester?

1170
01:23:52,514 --> 01:23:54,699
LAURA: Hmm?

1171
01:23:54,699 --> 01:24:02,481
MARISHA: Were you laughing to yourself last night?
I just kept hearing giggling. It was obnoxious.

1172
01:24:02,481 --> 01:24:03,863
LAURA: I'm sorry.

1173
01:24:03,863 --> 01:24:08,372
MARISHA: Uh-huh. I just get ready.

1174
01:24:08,372 --> 01:24:11,836
MATT: As a note, too, for all the drinks you guys
drank last night, that probably put you back about

1175
01:24:11,836 --> 01:24:13,702
one and a half gold.

1176
01:24:13,702 --> 01:24:16,724
TRAVIS: Molly, that's your tab, right?

1177
01:24:16,724 --> 01:24:19,836
TALIESIN: All but the one you bought me.

1178
01:24:19,836 --> 01:24:23,201
TRAVIS: Yeah, except for that one.

1179
01:24:23,201 --> 01:24:26,755
TALIESIN: To be fair, I didn't give you that
story.

1180
01:24:26,755 --> 01:24:29,474
TRAVIS: That's true.

1181
01:24:29,474 --> 01:24:35,229
TALIESIN: I very carefully start unfolding my robe
and it has my swords very carefully laid out in

1182
01:24:35,229 --> 01:24:41,529
there from the closet. I do a little prayer and
put everything back on.

1183
01:24:41,529 --> 01:24:44,020
TRAVIS: Are you praying over your swords?

1184
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,161
TALIESIN: I am, of course.

1185
01:24:46,161 --> 01:24:52,519
TRAVIS: Is that part of your thing?

1186
01:24:52,519 --> 01:24:54,242
TALIESIN: You seem honest.

1187
01:24:54,242 --> 01:24:55,610
TRAVIS: I try to be.

1188
01:24:55,610 --> 01:25:05,863
TALIESIN: Well, the swords are magic. According to
my mum, they go back in our family generations to

1189
01:25:05,863 --> 01:25:14,752
a very unusual rare line of tiefling that came
from a demon of ice that lived inside a volcano.

1190
01:25:14,752 --> 01:25:22,895
Our family, and I take this with a grain of salt,
were royal guards, were entrusted with these magic

1191
01:25:22,895 --> 01:25:30,695
swords and these swords can only be activated by
the blood of the royal family. So in honor of any

1192
01:25:30,695 --> 01:25:36,885
fighting I ever do with them, I make sure my blood
is at least drawn once.

1193
01:25:36,885 --> 01:25:39,042
TRAVIS: That's quite the story. Can I insight
check him?

1194
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:43,561
MATT: Yes, you may.

1195
01:25:43,561 --> 01:25:44,707
TRAVIS: 15.

1196
01:25:44,707 --> 01:25:46,569
TALIESIN: What am I fighting against?

1197
01:25:46,569 --> 01:25:48,194
MATT: This would be deception.

1198
01:25:48,194 --> 01:25:56,539
TALIESIN: That would be deception. All right. I'm
lying like a motherfucker.

1199
01:25:56,539 --> 01:26:06,634
TRAVIS: Well thank you for sharing that
honest story with me. It means a lot.

1200
01:26:06,634 --> 01:26:08,274
TALIESIN: I walk downstairs.

1201
01:26:08,274 --> 01:26:09,693
MATT: All right.

1202
01:26:09,693 --> 01:26:11,625
LAURA: Can I go knock on Fjord's door?

1203
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:13,131
MATT: Sure.

1204
01:26:13,131 --> 01:26:17,250
LAURA: Ey oh ey, good morning!

1205
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:21,234
SAM: She's a morning person too? Jesus.

1206
01:26:21,234 --> 01:26:23,792
TRAVIS: Ey oh ey yourself.

1207
01:26:23,792 --> 01:26:29,533
(laughter)

1208
01:26:29,533 --> 01:26:32,507
LAURA: Hey, do you want to get out of here?

1209
01:26:32,507 --> 01:26:36,331
TRAVIS: Yeah, we said we were going to do that,
didn't we? What did you have in mind?

1210
01:26:36,331 --> 01:26:41,577
LAURA: Well, we sneak out and then we go find out
why there are zombies.

1211
01:26:41,577 --> 01:26:42,992
TRAVIS: That's a detailed plan.

1212
01:26:42,992 --> 01:26:44,297
LAURA: Yes.

1213
01:26:44,297 --> 01:26:46,492
TRAVIS: I like it. Are we taking anybody with us?

1214
01:26:46,492 --> 01:26:49,890
LAURA: Well, if they can make themselves not look
like themselves, then sure.

1215
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:53,923
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Do you want to ask any of
them?

1216
01:26:53,923 --> 01:26:54,974
LAURA: Hey, Beau.

1217
01:26:54,974 --> 01:26:56,067
MARISHA: Yeah.

1218
01:26:56,067 --> 01:27:03,163
LAURA: Do you have anything you can do to make
yourself not look like you?

1219
01:27:03,163 --> 01:27:09,480
MARISHA: I take my robes and I flip them inside
out and I take some dirt and dirty it up a little

1220
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:18,650
bit and take my hair down and I steal
a scarf off of Jester's stuff and I do a

1221
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:21,161
bandana around my head.

1222
01:27:21,161 --> 01:27:24,328
LAURA: No, you look like you with a bandana around
your head.

1223
01:27:24,328 --> 01:27:28,439
TRAVIS: Yeah that's not going to cut it, not quite
like what we had in mind.

1224
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:29,925
LAURA: Yeah.

1225
01:27:29,925 --> 01:27:32,962
MARISHA: What are you guys doing? You guys
leaving? Are you guys fucking leaving? You're not

1226
01:27:32,962 --> 01:27:34,913
leaving without me are you?

1227
01:27:34,913 --> 01:27:36,157
LAURA: No, of course, we're coming back.

1228
01:27:36,157 --> 01:27:37,262
MARISHA: You're skipping town.

1229
01:27:37,262 --> 01:27:39,154
LAURA: No. Oh, but we could.

1230
01:27:39,154 --> 01:27:40,509
TRAVIS: She's right here.

1231
01:27:40,509 --> 01:27:42,390
LAURA: Okay.

1232
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,594
MARISHA: I could skip town with you, though. Do
you want to skip town?

1233
01:27:44,594 --> 01:27:50,944
LAURA: We'll be back.

1234
01:27:50,944 --> 01:27:56,573
TRAVIS: Let's see if Caleb and his little friend
are downstairs first. He has tricks after all.

1235
01:27:56,573 --> 01:27:58,216
LAURA: Right.

1236
01:27:58,216 --> 01:28:03,113
MATT: Okay, the two of you come to consciousness.
What are you up to?

1237
01:28:03,113 --> 01:28:04,742
SAM: Get some breakfast, I guess?

1238
01:28:04,742 --> 01:28:06,126
LIAM: Yeah, we're already down there.

1239
01:28:06,126 --> 01:28:07,527
MATT: You've already gone down there?

1240
01:28:07,527 --> 01:28:11,653
TALIESIN: I've already gone. I'm having breakfast.
I'm leaving a note with the barkeep for Yasha if

1241
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:12,764
she comes back.

1242
01:28:12,764 --> 01:28:13,935
MATT: Okay.

1243
01:28:13,935 --> 01:28:16,047
MARISHA: I guess I go down and have breakfast as
well.

1244
01:28:16,047 --> 01:28:19,844
MATT: As you guys wander down you find Caleb and
Nott already at a table and Mollymauk returning

1245
01:28:19,844 --> 01:28:26,262
from the bar after delivering that note.

1246
01:28:26,262 --> 01:28:27,706
TRAVIS: Y'all are downstairs?

1247
01:28:27,706 --> 01:28:32,467
SAM: (messy eating noises)

1248
01:28:32,467 --> 01:28:34,555
LAURA: Can I try to pick a piece of bacon off your
plate?

1249
01:28:34,555 --> 01:28:37,947
SAM: (growls) Sure, for you.

1250
01:28:37,947 --> 01:28:40,417
LAURA: Thanks.

1251
01:28:40,417 --> 01:28:51,939
TRAVIS: It's like a little dog. The little back
foot creeps up. (growls) If we could we're-- did

1252
01:28:51,939 --> 01:29:05,011
you just fucking? Shit. We were thinking of maybe
finding our way outside of the inn for a bit. I

1253
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:11,295
don't want to presume anything, but do you have
the ability to change the way you look?

1254
01:29:11,295 --> 01:29:13,847
LIAM: To change the way I look?

1255
01:29:13,847 --> 01:29:15,137
TRAVIS: Yeah. You know

1256
01:29:15,137 --> 01:29:16,226
LIAM: To leave the inn?

1257
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:17,210
TRAVIS: Yeah, assume a different form.

1258
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:18,962
LIAM: Why would I do that to leave the inn?

1259
01:29:18,962 --> 01:29:20,752
LAURA: So we can find out why there are zombies.

1260
01:29:20,752 --> 01:29:23,725
LIAM: Why wouldn't I just walk out of the inn?

1261
01:29:23,725 --> 01:29:25,903
LAURA: Well, because we were told we can't leave
the inn.

1262
01:29:25,903 --> 01:29:27,997
SAM: We weren't told that.

1263
01:29:27,997 --> 01:29:29,246
TRAVIS: Right.

1264
01:29:29,246 --> 01:29:31,487
LAURA: Huh. Well, that's convenient.

1265
01:29:31,487 --> 01:29:35,813
SAM: But I can change my appearance.

1266
01:29:35,813 --> 01:29:38,898
LAURA: Wow. I would never know it was you.

1267
01:29:38,898 --> 01:29:42,479
SAM: Yeah.

1268
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:45,886
TRAVIS: Molly, what about you?

1269
01:29:45,886 --> 01:29:55,264
TALIESIN: Well, I mean look at me. I go into my
bag. I do have a disguise kit. Don't I? I think I

1270
01:29:55,264 --> 01:30:04,469
do. It's so weird to just have things now. Yeah, I
have a disguise kit.

1271
01:30:04,469 --> 01:30:05,931
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

1272
01:30:05,931 --> 01:30:07,631
SAM: What does that mean?

1273
01:30:07,631 --> 01:30:11,747
MATT: It means he can use to try and disguise
himself. Hide features.

1274
01:30:11,747 --> 01:30:14,756
TALIESIN: It'd be a little tricky for me. I 
look like what I'm going to look like.

1275
01:30:14,756 --> 01:30:17,811
But the rest of you could do a little work.

1276
01:30:17,811 --> 01:30:20,921
TRAVIS: Beau, I don't want to leave you behind,
but I--

1277
01:30:20,921 --> 01:30:23,448
LAURA: It's true. I have a disguise kit, too. I
could help you out.

1278
01:30:23,448 --> 01:30:26,908
MARISHA: Would you do my makeup for me?

1279
01:30:26,908 --> 01:30:28,252
LAURA: I'm really good at makeup.

1280
01:30:28,252 --> 01:30:29,122
MARISHA: Are you?

1281
01:30:29,122 --> 01:30:29,815
LAURA: Yeah.

1282
01:30:29,815 --> 01:30:30,784
MARISHA: Let's do that.

1283
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,300
LAURA: I'm really shit at makeup.

1284
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:34,574
(laughter)

1285
01:30:34,574 --> 01:30:37,636
TALIESIN: We could just shower this one that would
be enough.

1286
01:30:37,636 --> 01:30:40,421
LAURA: He can leave, apparently.

1287
01:30:40,421 --> 01:30:44,551
LIAM: Yeah, we could. But not town, we were told
to stay in town.

1288
01:30:44,551 --> 01:30:47,278
LAURA: No, no, we're going to stay in town.

1289
01:30:47,278 --> 01:30:48,887
SAM: What are we doing again?

1290
01:30:48,887 --> 01:30:52,922
LAURA: We have to find out why there are zombies
so we that don't get arrested for being zombies.

1291
01:30:52,922 --> 01:30:58,520
SAM: So we solve the case to clear our own name.

1292
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:05,784
LIAM: Why shouldn't we just wait for it all to
blow over? We didn't do anything.

1293
01:31:05,784 --> 01:31:09,842
TALIESIN: I tend to find these things don't blow over
necessarily as more they just eventually decide

1294
01:31:09,842 --> 01:31:12,247
someone's guilty and take their revenge on them.

1295
01:31:12,247 --> 01:31:14,054
LIAM: Do you find yourself in situations like this
often?

1296
01:31:14,054 --> 01:31:16,912
TALIESIN: Not this particular one, but yes.

1297
01:31:16,912 --> 01:31:19,425
MARISHA: I mean, look at him. No offense or
anything.

1298
01:31:19,425 --> 01:31:24,436
TALIESIN: None taken, really. A little taken, but
that's fine.

1299
01:31:24,436 --> 01:31:27,676
TRAVIS: He makes a point. I think that the sooner
we find the cause of this, the sooner we can get

1300
01:31:27,676 --> 01:31:30,006
out of here.

1301
01:31:30,006 --> 01:31:34,176
TALIESIN: She's right, immediately the two of us
are going to get hit with this.

1302
01:31:34,176 --> 01:31:39,528
SAM: If we solve the case we would be absolved.
It's not a terrible plan.

1303
01:31:39,528 --> 01:31:43,640
MARISHA: And you're so concerned with your goblin
friend. I mean he's in the same boat as the

1304
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:44,623
tieflings.

1305
01:31:44,623 --> 01:31:46,574
LIAM: That's a girl.

1306
01:31:46,574 --> 01:31:47,966
LAURA: I know it's hard to tell.

1307
01:31:47,966 --> 01:31:49,853
MARISHA: I said your goblin friend.

1308
01:31:49,853 --> 01:31:50,853
LAURA and LAURA: You said he.

1309
01:31:50,853 --> 01:31:52,423
MARISHA: Whatever.

1310
01:31:52,423 --> 01:31:59,465
SAM: Listen, we've all had a rough night. I know
that my features aren't necessarily the most

1311
01:31:59,465 --> 01:32:08,453
feminine. Among goblin kind, I understand. It's
hard to tell.

1312
01:32:08,453 --> 01:32:09,610
LAURA: I can tell.

1313
01:32:09,610 --> 01:32:11,761
LIAM: Everybody can tell.

1314
01:32:11,761 --> 01:32:13,466
LAURA: Yeah.

1315
01:32:13,466 --> 01:32:16,235
MARISHA: I'm working on it.

1316
01:32:16,235 --> 01:32:23,894
TRAVIS: Let's get out of here. Can I walk back
into a privy, washroom area?

1317
01:32:23,894 --> 01:32:27,890
MATT: Yeah, upstairs at the very end of the hall
is the communal washroom.

1318
01:32:27,890 --> 01:32:32,511
TRAVIS: Can I use my Mask of Many Faces to cast
Disguise Self on myself?

1319
01:32:32,511 --> 01:32:34,176
MATT: Sure, what form so you want to take?

1320
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:41,443
TRAVIS: Older, white-haired, with a beard. Just
very simple peasant's clothes. Maybe a bit of a

1321
01:32:41,443 --> 01:32:43,457
farmer or a land worker.

1322
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:52,559
MATT: Okay, easily enough. Basic browns and tans
and general farm worker's tunic and supplies.

1323
01:32:52,559 --> 01:32:53,936
TRAVIS: Smudges, dirt on the fingernails.

1324
01:32:53,936 --> 01:32:55,810
MATT: Yeah, easy enough.

1325
01:32:55,810 --> 01:33:01,319
LAURA: I'm going to help Beau. You know what I'm
going to do for you? I'm going to use my disguise

1326
01:33:01,319 --> 01:33:03,511
kit I'm going to give you a beard.

1327
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:04,957
MARISHA: Oh, yeah!

1328
01:33:04,957 --> 01:33:10,061
LAURA: Yeah and I'm going to turn you into a dude,
that's a good disguise, right?

1329
01:33:10,061 --> 01:33:10,881
MARISHA: Yeah.

1330
01:33:10,881 --> 01:33:15,510
LAURA. Yeah, and a mustache. And a hat.

1331
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:17,226
MARISHA: Love it.

1332
01:33:17,226 --> 01:33:21,280
SAM: You really have to sell it though, and act
like a dude.

1333
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,457
MARISHA: (low, gravelly voice) I think I can do that.

1334
01:33:24,457 --> 01:33:26,434
SAM: Oh yes!

1335
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:32,337
MARISHA: I'm going to go a step further and tape
down my boobs, bandage them down all the way, you

1336
01:33:32,337 --> 01:33:36,042
know wrap them. Stuff my crotch a little bit.

1337
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:40,917
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make a dexterity
check.

1338
01:33:40,917 --> 01:33:44,317
TALIESIN: Do you want assistance with this?

1339
01:33:44,317 --> 01:33:47,475
LAURA: Was he helping me?

1340
01:33:47,475 --> 01:33:48,819
MATT: If you want to.

1341
01:33:48,819 --> 01:33:49,788
LAURA: Sure.

1342
01:33:49,788 --> 01:33:51,292
MATT: So take it with advantage.

1343
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:52,430
TALIESIN: Oh, with advantage.

1344
01:33:52,430 --> 01:34:02,131
LAURA: Good. Okay, with the advantage. Dexterity.
15.

1345
01:34:02,131 --> 01:34:06,189
MATT: 15, okay. You actually manage to sell a
decent disguise.

1346
01:34:06,189 --> 01:34:08,599
MARISHA: Do I have some five o'clock shadow?

1347
01:34:08,599 --> 01:34:15,570
MATT: At a distance, at like three or four feet
would be passable and walking quickly by. Upon

1348
01:34:15,570 --> 01:34:17,868
close inspection, you could see through it.

1349
01:34:17,868 --> 01:34:21,328
LIAM: Is it like one of those old kids toys where
you use the magnet to pull the little filings up?

1350
01:34:21,328 --> 01:34:22,394
MATT: More or less.

1351
01:34:22,394 --> 01:34:24,515
MARISHA: Mr. Woolly?

1352
01:34:24,515 --> 01:34:27,015
MATT: A medieval version of that.

1353
01:34:27,015 --> 01:34:28,978
LIAM: Herr Woolly.

1354
01:34:28,978 --> 01:34:32,893
MATT: But impressive. Using the kit and using
whatever scraps of clothing you can find and amass

1355
01:34:32,893 --> 01:34:41,927
you manage to get a relatively top-knot Silverlake
hobo version of Beau functionally ready to go.

1356
01:34:41,927 --> 01:34:44,938
LAURA: It's good, it's good.

1357
01:34:44,938 --> 01:34:49,462
MARISHA: Wait Fjord how do you sound? Say words,
you're manly.

1358
01:34:49,462 --> 01:34:57,996
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Manly words. Mirror image. I
got nuts.

1359
01:34:57,996 --> 01:35:01,481
(laughter)

1360
01:35:01,481 --> 01:35:17,275
LAURA: And I'll cast Disguise Self on myself, as
well, and turn myself into a human with blonde

1361
01:35:17,275 --> 01:35:23,875
hair and she's going to be very clean-looking.

1362
01:35:23,875 --> 01:35:26,646
SAM: Angelina.

1363
01:35:26,646 --> 01:35:35,636
LAURA: Yes! With big lips, and a couple jewels on
her fingers.

1364
01:35:35,636 --> 01:35:42,055
MATT: Okay. Just double-checking here, Disguise
Self lasts for, is it an hour? Yeah, I thought it

1365
01:35:42,055 --> 01:35:47,207
was an hour. So while they're doing that, are you
using your disguise kit on yourself?

1366
01:35:47,207 --> 01:35:53,985
TALIESIN: I assume I've just got some very basic
black robe that just--

1367
01:35:53,985 --> 01:35:57,909
MATT: Yeah, with a cloak and hood and make-up, you
can probably pass for human as long as you keep

1368
01:35:57,909 --> 01:36:01,395
the hood up, and keep most of your more
ostentatious garb hidden.

1369
01:36:01,395 --> 01:36:03,851
TALIESIN: I'm sure I've got a set.

1370
01:36:03,851 --> 01:36:06,996
MATT: Go ahead and make a dexterity check for your
disguise kit.

1371
01:36:06,996 --> 01:36:07,989
LAURA: Do you want help?

1372
01:36:07,989 --> 01:36:12,770
TALIESIN: Yes please, this is a lot of work. It's
a natural 20, that'll do it.

1373
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:23,511
MATT: All right. Between making your skin tone
more of a natural tan, peach humanoid color, bring

1374
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:27,645
the hood up. You actually pull some of your hair
forward and adhere it a bit around the horns so

1375
01:36:27,645 --> 01:36:33,302
that it looks almost like a cluster of hair in the
front. You manage to tuck in and tie your robe

1376
01:36:33,302 --> 01:36:39,317
behind you, your usual clothing, and then using an
over-robe to hide most of the material, and you

1377
01:36:39,317 --> 01:36:45,699
look like a dude passing through. So with that
your disguises are complete, your spells are cast.

1378
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:49,873
MARISHA: Is that your human face?

1379
01:36:49,873 --> 01:36:53,248
LIAM: While they're doing all that, I want to
stroll outside and see if there's crownsguard

1380
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:57,134
outside, or what. I'm just going to get a breath
of fresh air and see what's on the street outside

1381
01:36:57,134 --> 01:36:58,384
of this place.

1382
01:36:58,384 --> 01:37:05,009
MATT: Okay. As you exit, there are two gentlemen
in full crownsguard gear. One is standing outside,

1383
01:37:05,009 --> 01:37:08,418
the other is currently sitting in a chair, and as
soon as you walk past, they both scan you up and

1384
01:37:08,418 --> 01:37:11,288
down, continue to watch you pass by.

1385
01:37:11,288 --> 01:37:15,850
LIAM: Good. There's only just the two at the
door?

1386
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:17,792
MATT: Just the two that you can see at the front,
yes.

1387
01:37:17,792 --> 01:37:24,560
LIAM: Okay, all right. So I just take a minute or
two. I go back inside. And-- on Nott's shoulder

1388
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,514
and say we're good, yeah, I think we're good.

1389
01:37:26,514 --> 01:37:28,306
SAM: Excellent.

1390
01:37:28,306 --> 01:37:30,974
LAURA: Should we try to do this, then?

1391
01:37:30,974 --> 01:37:32,988
TRAVIS: In twos, or singles.

1392
01:37:32,988 --> 01:37:35,765
LAURA: Yeah, of course, not all at the same time,
that's obvious.

1393
01:37:35,765 --> 01:37:38,023
TRAVIS: Level two, trying to get out of a fucking
inn.

1394
01:37:38,023 --> 01:37:39,688
MARISHA: It's so hard.

1395
01:37:39,688 --> 01:37:41,436
TALIESIN: Now I'm kicking myself.

1396
01:37:41,436 --> 01:37:43,911
MARISHA: So anxiety-inducing.

1397
01:37:43,911 --> 01:37:47,488
TALIESIN: No, never mind, I didn't do it at the
time, I can't do it now. No retconning, never

1398
01:37:47,488 --> 01:37:48,597
mind.

1399
01:37:48,597 --> 01:37:55,101
LIAM: I'm going to squat down over with you,
privately. I still think that this is a bad idea,

1400
01:37:55,101 --> 01:37:57,726
but I can tell that you want to.

1401
01:37:57,726 --> 01:38:05,627
SAM: Well it's just that-- listen, there's no
offense, I enjoy our talks and your schooling and

1402
01:38:05,627 --> 01:38:13,390
everything, but I haven't talked this openly and
freely with other people in months. It's amazing.

1403
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:15,390
LIAM: It really is pretty nice, isn't it?

1404
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:17,029
SAM: Yes!

1405
01:38:17,029 --> 01:38:19,506
LIAM: Still, if this goes south, we leave.

1406
01:38:19,506 --> 01:38:21,318
SAM: We're the first ones out the door.

1407
01:38:21,318 --> 01:38:22,507
LIAM: Easily.

1408
01:38:22,507 --> 01:38:25,127
SAM: Yeah. They'll never know who we were.

1409
01:38:25,127 --> 01:38:26,746
LIAM: Caleb and Nott.

1410
01:38:26,746 --> 01:38:31,256
SAM: Well, don't say that too much. I mean, yes,
they do know that we're Caleb and Nott, yes.

1411
01:38:31,256 --> 01:38:32,623
LIAM: All right.

1412
01:38:32,623 --> 01:38:33,445
SAM: Okay.

1413
01:38:33,445 --> 01:38:34,332
LIAM: So we're doing this?

1414
01:38:34,332 --> 01:38:38,095
SAM: Yeah, let's just go with, and see where it
leads.

1415
01:38:38,095 --> 01:38:40,319
LAURA: Can I walk up to Nott?

1416
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:43,033
SAM: Hi! Yes, we weren't talking!

1417
01:38:43,033 --> 01:38:44,820
LAURA: (high-pitched) Do you like my outfit?

1418
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:50,953
SAM: Oh! What are you? I'm sorry, I'm just a young
girl from the village.

1419
01:38:50,953 --> 01:38:54,109
LAURA: And I'm just a young girl from town.

1420
01:38:54,109 --> 01:38:58,371
SAM: I don't know anything. I should go get my
father.

1421
01:38:58,371 --> 01:39:02,256
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) New York is where I'd
rather stay!

1422
01:39:02,256 --> 01:39:06,668
(laughter)

1423
01:39:06,668 --> 01:39:10,204
LAURA: Nott, it's me! It's Jester!

1424
01:39:10,204 --> 01:39:12,278
SAM: But you look like--

1425
01:39:12,278 --> 01:39:19,524
LAURA: I know! This is how good I am at magic!
Check me out. Are we leaving here or not?

1426
01:39:19,524 --> 01:39:23,127
SAM: Are you afraid you'll be propositioned on the
street?

1427
01:39:23,127 --> 01:39:25,578
LAURA: I am really attractive right now.

1428
01:39:25,578 --> 01:39:29,521
SAM: Those lips are very big.

1429
01:39:29,521 --> 01:39:31,863
LAURA: I came over here to give you the blessing!

1430
01:39:31,863 --> 01:39:33,527
SAM: What is that? What does that do?

1431
01:39:33,527 --> 01:39:35,159
LAURA: It helps you with your stealthing!

1432
01:39:35,159 --> 01:39:38,432
SAM: Oh, the stealthy thing, yes, thank you so
much, I'll accept it.

1433
01:39:38,432 --> 01:39:41,578
LAURA: You're welcome. Okay, that's it. But I'll
see you outside at some point, okay? Don't be

1434
01:39:41,578 --> 01:39:42,975
scared, come up to me.

1435
01:39:42,975 --> 01:39:44,345
SAM and LAURA: Okay.

1436
01:39:44,345 --> 01:39:46,099
MATT: Okay, in what order are you leaving?

1437
01:39:46,099 --> 01:39:47,042
TRAVIS: Should I go first?

1438
01:39:47,042 --> 01:39:48,063
LAURA: Sure!

1439
01:39:48,063 --> 01:39:53,305
MARISHA: Are we going out in pairs? Like you said?
(Deeper) Are we going out in pairs?

1440
01:39:53,305 --> 01:39:56,400
TALIESIN: Has Adelaine noticed any of this?

1441
01:39:56,400 --> 01:40:00,760
MATT: I imagine you guys have been using your
disguise kits in your own rooms and chambers.

1442
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:06,045
Other than that, no one immediately seems to be
noticing. Make a perception check.

1443
01:40:06,045 --> 01:40:08,280
TRAVIS: Not command ops in the tavern hall.

1444
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:12,395
TALIESIN: Let's call that a--

1445
01:40:12,395 --> 01:40:13,398
LAURA: 14!

1446
01:40:13,398 --> 01:40:15,590
TALIESIN: 14, thank you.

1447
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:22,278
MATT: You do see Yorda, the barkeep, in the
process of wiping out some glasses at the end,

1448
01:40:22,278 --> 01:40:31,949
she's occasionally giving a glance over to you
guys as you're walking around.

1449
01:40:31,949 --> 01:40:33,550
LAURA: (whispering) You go first!

1450
01:40:33,550 --> 01:40:35,713
TRAVIS: You want to come with?

1451
01:40:35,713 --> 01:40:38,256
MARISHA: Yeah.

1452
01:40:38,256 --> 01:40:50,113
TRAVIS: Don't do anything stupid. Mouth shut, eyes
forward. Show me how you walk. Maybe a little

1453
01:40:50,113 --> 01:40:57,006
less. That's nice. I also assume a little limp,
slight.

1454
01:40:57,006 --> 01:41:01,444
MATT: I'll say for the purpose of this, each of
you make a performance check.

1455
01:41:01,444 --> 01:41:08,226
LAURA: Oh, god.

1456
01:41:08,226 --> 01:41:13,836
TRAVIS: 20.

1457
01:41:13,836 --> 01:41:15,283
MARISHA: 16.

1458
01:41:15,283 --> 01:41:20,234
MATT: Okay. The both of you exit out, holding your
breath. Out of your peripheral you can see the

1459
01:41:20,234 --> 01:41:28,784
deep reds and golds of the crownsguard armor
flanking you as you breach the outer porch of the

1460
01:41:28,784 --> 01:41:40,250
tavern, stepping down into the dust to the main
street. You curve to the left and see nor hear any

1461
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:42,546
reaction from either of them.

1462
01:41:42,546 --> 01:41:44,895
TRAVIS: Just keep moving to the other side of the
street.

1463
01:41:44,895 --> 01:41:49,052
TALIESIN: I go single just a little bit after, and
I rolled a natural 20.

1464
01:41:49,052 --> 01:41:50,340
SAM: Is that three for the night?

1465
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:51,224
TALIESIN: Yep.

1466
01:41:51,224 --> 01:41:52,400
SAM: Oh my god.

1467
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:53,554
TRAVIS: What color is that die?

1468
01:41:53,554 --> 01:42:00,597
TALIESIN: It seems to be iron, like my will.

1469
01:42:00,597 --> 01:42:05,603
MATT: It may not have been the snitch after all,
you asshole.

1470
01:42:05,603 --> 01:42:07,591
TALIESIN: Me and my magic swords.

1471
01:42:07,591 --> 01:42:12,220
MATT: Apparently. All right, you saunter by
without an issue. By saunter, I mean you stumble

1472
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:19,042
through. You hear a cough at one point, and it
causes you a moment, but you just continue on

1473
01:42:19,042 --> 01:42:20,640
without notice.

1474
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:23,766
LAURA: Oh, everybody's leaving and I didn't have a
partner!

1475
01:42:23,766 --> 01:42:25,653
MARISHA: It's fine, don't worry about it.

1476
01:42:25,653 --> 01:42:28,377
SAM: You can come with us, if you like.

1477
01:42:28,377 --> 01:42:32,831
LAURA: But I feel like you guys are noticeable and
why would I be this really beautiful woman leaving

1478
01:42:32,831 --> 01:42:37,372
with the stinky guy?

1479
01:42:37,372 --> 01:42:50,104
SAM: It's quickly becoming canon that you just
have shit smeared all over you. You could travel

1480
01:42:50,104 --> 01:42:53,630
with me! I could be your daughter.

1481
01:42:53,630 --> 01:42:54,818
LAURA: You're my daughter!

1482
01:42:54,818 --> 01:43:01,899
SAM: Yes! We're a couple, and he's our guard or
something, I don't know.

1483
01:43:01,899 --> 01:43:05,287
LAURA: Yeah! You leave after us Caleb, okay?

1484
01:43:05,287 --> 01:43:07,318
LIAM: Isn't it simpler for you to walk on yourself
like a beautiful woman?

1485
01:43:07,318 --> 01:43:09,742
LAURA: No, me and Nott are going to go together.
Okay, come on, Nott!

1486
01:43:09,742 --> 01:43:12,673
SAM: I'm sorry, she's very forward.

1487
01:43:12,673 --> 01:43:14,234
LAURA: Come on sweetie, let's go.

1488
01:43:14,234 --> 01:43:15,859
SAM: Yes, mommy!

1489
01:43:15,859 --> 01:43:18,101
LAURA: And we walk out.

1490
01:43:18,101 --> 01:43:23,988
MATT: You guys don't have to make a performance
check because you've exited before, and you're

1491
01:43:23,988 --> 01:43:28,327
completely visually a different individual, so you
guys pass through without an issue. Caleb, you can

1492
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:32,265
follow up behind, as you are not currently under
direct guard in the tavern. They do notice you

1493
01:43:32,265 --> 01:43:39,069
exit, and they're aware of your presence, but you
are not confined to the tavern. So you guys all

1494
01:43:39,069 --> 01:43:44,595
manage to slowly come together a few blocks down
and out of the sight of the crownsguard guarding

1495
01:43:44,595 --> 01:43:48,497
the Nestled Nook Inn, and where are you off to?

1496
01:43:48,497 --> 01:43:51,421
LAURA: We did it! Where should we go?

1497
01:43:51,421 --> 01:43:53,490
TRAVIS: Let's just keep walking for now.

1498
01:43:53,490 --> 01:43:58,998
LAURA: Okay. Should we walk toward the carnival
where the zombies were?

1499
01:43:58,998 --> 01:44:02,100
TALIESIN: Who was he, would be my question.

1500
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:06,967
LAURA: Oh, right. We should find out where he's
from. How do we do that? Should we ask around and

1501
01:44:06,967 --> 01:44:13,137
say hey, anybody know where the old guy came from
that turned into a zombie?

1502
01:44:13,137 --> 01:44:14,840
TRAVIS: That's a good point.

1503
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:17,529
TALIESIN: Seems to be the most appropriate thing
to ask at this point.

1504
01:44:17,529 --> 01:44:21,518
LIAM: Well, we could find some public places and
just gossip a bit, see if anybody has heard of

1505
01:44:21,518 --> 01:44:25,266
him, if a friend has died at the circus last
night.

1506
01:44:25,266 --> 01:44:30,010
MARISHA: I mean, you mentioned no sick people. If
he was sick, sometimes that word gets around.

1507
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:33,452
TRAVIS: Maybe there is a morgue, maybe they
recognized him.

1508
01:44:33,452 --> 01:44:37,564
TALIESIN: These small towns, most everyone knows
everybody else.

1509
01:44:37,564 --> 01:44:39,810
LAURA: Let's go to, is there a market area?

1510
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:45,266
MATT: They don't have a large bazaar, but there is
an area that is generally where a lot of the

1511
01:44:45,266 --> 01:44:56,032
simple wares and vegetables and meats and people
who sell small things that they craft their own

1512
01:44:56,032 --> 01:45:05,639
at, it's a small market. If you want to make an
investigation check.

1513
01:45:05,639 --> 01:45:07,405
LAURA: 16.

1514
01:45:07,405 --> 01:45:14,583
MATT: Okay, by going around asking questions and
inquiring and trying to prod people to talk about

1515
01:45:14,583 --> 01:45:20,783
what transpired the night before, the information
you gather involves the man who passed away. His

1516
01:45:20,783 --> 01:45:23,166
name is Enon Brinjay.

1517
01:45:23,166 --> 01:45:25,529
LIAM: Grimjay?

1518
01:45:25,529 --> 01:45:44,761
MATT: Brinjay. He's a standard human being in his
early 80s. He's old, but healthy, it seemed.

1519
01:45:44,761 --> 01:45:46,555
TRAVIS: Was he in good health?

1520
01:45:46,555 --> 01:45:49,150
MATT: Seemed to be in good health for his age.

1521
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:52,984
LIAM: So our war against the old continues.

1522
01:45:52,984 --> 01:45:55,261
MATT: Apparently.

1523
01:45:55,261 --> 01:45:59,654
TALIESIN: We're the Logan's Run of D&D.

1524
01:45:59,654 --> 01:46:06,461
MATT: He seemed to have been retired for quite
some time, but had been making little bits here

1525
01:46:06,461 --> 01:46:14,240
and there, helping the fishermen move fish to and
from the outside of the lake. He wasn't really

1526
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:18,921
well known. The reason people are talking about
him now is because the word is gotten around and

1527
01:46:18,921 --> 01:46:24,787
gossiped about, but for the most part, he was one
of the many faceless people that live in the town.

1528
01:46:24,787 --> 01:46:27,425
A handful knew his name.

1529
01:46:27,425 --> 01:46:29,635
TALIESIN: Retired fisherman?

1530
01:46:29,635 --> 01:46:31,778
MARISHA: He was helping.

1531
01:46:31,778 --> 01:46:35,492
TALIESIN: Do we know where he was retired from and
where he was staying, maybe where he was drinking?

1532
01:46:35,492 --> 01:46:37,667
He had to go somewhere.

1533
01:46:37,667 --> 01:46:47,068
MATT: Actually, he was known often to be drinking
at The Old Mud Hole Tavern.

1534
01:46:47,068 --> 01:46:50,365
TALIESIN: Is that with the weird "e" spelling?

1535
01:46:50,365 --> 01:46:52,301
MATT: No, just "old."

1536
01:46:52,301 --> 01:46:53,181
TALIESIN: I'm always a fan.

1537
01:46:53,181 --> 01:46:54,296
MATT: I know.

1538
01:46:54,296 --> 01:46:55,573
LAURA: "Ye olde."

1539
01:46:55,573 --> 01:47:00,027
TALIESIN: "Ye olde" It's pronounced "the" when you
see the ye.

1540
01:47:00,027 --> 01:47:06,118
TRAVIS: I should point out this is the second
connection to the Ustaloch.

1541
01:47:06,118 --> 01:47:08,274
TALIESIN: The what?

1542
01:47:08,274 --> 01:47:13,823
TRAVIS: Well, before we met up with you two, we
fought off a wicked, sick water snake.

1543
01:47:13,823 --> 01:47:16,588
LAURA: It came up out of the lake for some
reason.

1544
01:47:16,588 --> 01:47:18,752
TALIESIN: Is this a metaphor or is this actually a
real thing?

1545
01:47:18,752 --> 01:47:21,171
LAURA: It really happened. I almost died.

1546
01:47:21,171 --> 01:47:23,603
MARISHA: I punched a snake to death.

1547
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:25,168
LAURA: She did.

1548
01:47:25,168 --> 01:47:28,362
SAM: There were the snakes in the circus last
night, but it wasn't related to the attack, I

1549
01:47:28,362 --> 01:47:29,060
suppose.

1550
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:30,903
LAURA: A little different.

1551
01:47:30,903 --> 01:47:32,878
LIAM: How long of a snake are we talking about?

1552
01:47:32,878 --> 01:47:39,579
MARISHA: Oh, it was a giant water snake, then the
little girls were complaining about more and more

1553
01:47:39,579 --> 01:47:43,350
instances of these snakes coming out of the lake.

1554
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:47,404
SAM: And this fellow who died worked with the
fishermen in the lake?

1555
01:47:47,404 --> 01:47:52,721
LAURA: Well, he took some jobs with them. Did
anybody see him the day of the carnival? Was he

1556
01:47:52,721 --> 01:47:55,087
working with anyone that day?

1557
01:47:55,087 --> 01:47:59,523
MATT: You don't find any of that information. That
would be an intense investigation. You would have

1558
01:47:59,523 --> 01:48:02,863
to go beyond asking questions around a market.

1559
01:48:02,863 --> 01:48:05,720
SAM: Is the lake within the city limits?

1560
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:06,935
MARISHA: Yeah.

1561
01:48:06,935 --> 01:48:09,962
MATT: It's technically considered part of the
city. It might not be an issue.

1562
01:48:09,962 --> 01:48:16,515
LAURA: Where's Ye Olde Mud Hole Tavern at?

1563
01:48:16,515 --> 01:48:20,252
MATT: The Mud Hole Tavern, you've been to before.

1564
01:48:20,252 --> 01:48:21,880
TALIESIN: I was doing my rounds.

1565
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:24,461
MATT: Yeah, when you first entered the city, so
you can--

1566
01:48:24,461 --> 01:48:26,886
MARISHA: The Lochward, is that what we're talking
about?

1567
01:48:26,886 --> 01:48:32,180
MATT: The Lochward is where the Old Mud Hole would
be at. The Lochward is to the eastern side of the

1568
01:48:32,180 --> 01:48:35,246
entire city. The Lochward is the central one.

1569
01:48:35,246 --> 01:48:38,466
LIAM: The wards border the lake.

1570
01:48:38,466 --> 01:48:45,118
MATT: So you make your way to the Old Mud Hole.
Entering inside, this is a dark dive of a bar,

1571
01:48:45,118 --> 01:48:58,655
you've been there once before. It smells heavily
of old, wet wood, ale stains, and peanut. It's a

1572
01:48:58,655 --> 01:49:03,979
very small area and of the four tables that are
there, they are mostly empty, except for one old

1573
01:49:03,979 --> 01:49:09,738
man who is sitting there in the process of playing
a game of solitaire with his cards and a man in

1574
01:49:09,738 --> 01:49:15,538
his 30s thumbing through a book, who would be the
barkeep if there were more patrons at the moment.

1575
01:49:15,538 --> 01:49:21,613
He's flipping through and glances up and gives you
a look as you enter. "Can I help you? Are you

1576
01:49:21,613 --> 01:49:24,319
"looking for drinks? Can I get you anything?"

1577
01:49:24,319 --> 01:49:27,454
LIAM: Yeah, I would really love a drink and I sit
down next to him. What do you have? I need

1578
01:49:27,454 --> 01:49:31,136
something heavier than a trost. I've had enough
trosts to last me a lifetime.

1579
01:49:31,136 --> 01:49:32,698
MATT: "We have liquor."

1580
01:49:32,698 --> 01:49:34,805
LIAM: I will take your liquor.

1581
01:49:34,805 --> 01:49:38,231
MATT: "I will get some whiskey for you then.
Whiskey, everyone?"

1582
01:49:38,231 --> 01:49:39,337
MARISHA: Sure.

1583
01:49:39,337 --> 01:49:42,953
SAM: Two please.

1584
01:49:42,953 --> 01:49:52,173
LAURA: It's okay. She's my daughter. She loves
whiskey. I don't even remember what voice I was doing.

1585
01:49:52,173 --> 01:49:54,782
(laughing)

1586
01:49:54,782 --> 01:49:58,132
MATT: Make a deception check.

1587
01:49:58,132 --> 01:50:07,192
LAURA: I let her have any whiskey she wants. Oh,
that's pretty good. 17.

1588
01:50:07,192 --> 01:50:12,393
TALIESIN: We've been doing a pub crawl.

1589
01:50:12,393 --> 01:50:17,747
MATT: He goes and lines up a few small containers,
fills whiskey for all of you. "All right, that

1590
01:50:17,747 --> 01:50:24,818
"will be eight silver for the batch."

1591
01:50:24,818 --> 01:50:30,425
LIAM: I have that. I pull out eight silver. Oh
wait, silver, did you say? I do not have eight

1592
01:50:30,425 --> 01:50:32,162
silver.

1593
01:50:32,162 --> 01:50:34,789
LAURA: It's okay. I have it.

1594
01:50:34,789 --> 01:50:35,942
LIAM: You do?

1595
01:50:35,942 --> 01:50:39,416
LAURA: Sure. 
(high-pitched voice) I mean, sure.

1596
01:50:39,416 --> 01:50:45,747
MATT: He takes the silver and puts it away, slides
the drinks to the rest of you and goes back to his

1597
01:50:45,747 --> 01:50:48,573
book and starts thumbing through again.

1598
01:50:48,573 --> 01:50:57,490
LIAM: Honestly, it's been a terrible 24 hours. We
were at the circus last night and I did not know

1599
01:50:57,490 --> 01:51:02,680
him well, but old man Brinjay fell.

1600
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:07,844
MATT: He looks up and goes, "Enon, it's sad to see
him go and many of us were wondering what day it

1601
01:51:07,844 --> 01:51:09,145
"was going to be."

1602
01:51:09,145 --> 01:51:11,067
LIAM: Did you know him?

1603
01:51:11,067 --> 01:51:14,259
MATT: "He came in here most every day to drink.
He's a lonely man."

1604
01:51:14,259 --> 01:51:19,373
LIAM: It was a terrible way to go. I'm sorry.

1605
01:51:19,373 --> 01:51:24,073
MATT: "Doesn't bother me one way or the other.
Just sad to lose a patron."

1606
01:51:24,073 --> 01:51:28,659
LAURA: Do you know who was talking to him the day
of the carnival?

1607
01:51:28,659 --> 01:51:35,725
MATT: "I don't recall. Sometimes he would tell
stories to whoever was willing to listen and not

1608
01:51:35,725 --> 01:51:37,506
"most were willing to listen."

1609
01:51:37,506 --> 01:51:39,131
LAURA: Was he here that day?

1610
01:51:39,131 --> 01:51:40,833
MATT: "Yesterday?"

1611
01:51:40,833 --> 01:51:42,622
LAURA: Yeah.

1612
01:51:42,622 --> 01:51:47,926
MATT: "I think he came in briefly for a drink
before the carnival, but that was it."

1613
01:51:47,926 --> 01:51:52,671
MARISHA: You know, we should drink to old stories
of Brinjay.

1614
01:51:52,671 --> 01:51:55,842
TRAVIS: (shushes)

1615
01:51:55,842 --> 01:52:01,292
TALIESIN: I down my shot. What did the man drink
out of curiosity? What was his final drink? I'm a

1616
01:52:01,292 --> 01:52:03,992
bit of a macabre person myself.

1617
01:52:03,992 --> 01:52:06,189
MATT: "It's this very whiskey you just had."

1618
01:52:06,189 --> 01:52:09,390
TALIESIN: I'll take one more, and I'll get one of
my own.

1619
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:13,061
LIAM: I heard he was sick, too.

1620
01:52:13,061 --> 01:52:24,601
MATT: "I don't believe he was ill. I hope not. He
seemed to be rather wasting away. You shouldn't be

1621
01:52:24,601 --> 01:52:27,228
doing so much manual labor at that age."

1622
01:52:27,228 --> 01:52:29,327
SAM: What labor was he doing?

1623
01:52:29,327 --> 01:52:33,856
MATT: "He carries stuff around from small tasks
to--

1624
01:52:33,856 --> 01:52:35,225
SAM: Down at the docks?

1625
01:52:35,225 --> 01:52:42,572
MATT: "The docks, up at the North Ward. He carried
crates, boxes. Just odd jobs, ways to get by 'til

1626
01:52:42,572 --> 01:52:47,774
"the end of his days, which now that they've come,
may he rest and not have to do odd jobs ever

1627
01:52:47,774 --> 01:52:51,536
"again." He pours his own bit of whiskey.

1628
01:52:51,536 --> 01:52:53,190
ALL: Cheers.

1629
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:57,336
LAURA: Do you know who he was doing odd jobs for
that day?

1630
01:52:57,336 --> 01:53:03,228
SAM: Your lady voice is worse than mine.

1631
01:53:03,228 --> 01:53:06,797
MATT: "To be honest, if he did, I wasn't paying
attention."

1632
01:53:06,797 --> 01:53:09,295
LIAM: I'm sure his family will miss him very
much.

1633
01:53:09,295 --> 01:53:16,484
MATT: "There's nobody nearby. He had a son about
35 years ago, but he got married and went up

1634
01:53:16,484 --> 01:53:19,353
"north."

1635
01:53:19,353 --> 01:53:24,600
TRAVIS: Did he work for any of the particular
breweries around?

1636
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:31,268
MATT: "I don't know. Maybe."

1637
01:53:31,268 --> 01:53:38,969
MARISHA: Brinjay.

1638
01:53:38,969 --> 01:53:42,783
LAURA: Where did he sit in here?

1639
01:53:42,783 --> 01:53:46,912
MATT: He points over to the not the table the guy
is playing solitaire on, but the empty table to

1640
01:53:46,912 --> 01:53:51,363
the right of him. "Usually right there in the
corner."

1641
01:53:51,363 --> 01:53:56,162
LAURA: I go sit in the corner. I'm going to look
for anything I can find that looks like an old man was

1642
01:53:56,162 --> 01:53:57,882
touching it.

1643
01:53:57,882 --> 01:53:59,751
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

1644
01:53:59,751 --> 01:54:06,728
LAURA: Okay. I'm really good at these. 12.

1645
01:54:06,728 --> 01:54:16,751
MATT: 12. It looks like probably old person
touching has been all over here. Yes. The table is

1646
01:54:16,751 --> 01:54:23,069
very old and warped in places, stains all over it.
It's not a very good table. It's seen some rough

1647
01:54:23,069 --> 01:54:27,186
days.

1648
01:54:27,186 --> 01:54:31,381
TRAVIS: If we were to go down to the docks and ask
after a few people he worked with, is there anyone

1649
01:54:31,381 --> 01:54:36,122
you know that we should speak to, familiar of
his?

1650
01:54:36,122 --> 01:54:40,269
MATT: "I apologize. I served him drinks and
pretended to listen to him many times, but I

1651
01:54:40,269 --> 01:54:42,041
"wasn't really paying attention."

1652
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:44,569
TRAVIS: I understand that.

1653
01:54:44,569 --> 01:54:50,524
MARISHA: Is there anyone who did? That wasn't
hypothetical.

1654
01:54:50,524 --> 01:55:00,005
MATT: "Maybe. I apologize. I spend most of my days
reading." He lifts the book.

1655
01:55:00,005 --> 01:55:02,618
MARISHA: What's the book?

1656
01:55:02,618 --> 01:55:04,466
SAM: You read!

1657
01:55:04,466 --> 01:55:07,076
LIAM: Subtle, guys.

1658
01:55:07,076 --> 01:55:12,131
TALIESIN: We got a reader. While they're doing
this, I'm going to saunter over to the card

1659
01:55:12,131 --> 01:55:13,632
player.

1660
01:55:13,632 --> 01:55:17,440
LIAM: Can I see what's on the spine of that book
from where I am?

1661
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:29,536
MATT: At a glance at it, it's in Zemnian, which
you can read. The translation would come about to

1662
01:55:29,536 --> 01:55:33,067
The Rosed Embrace.

1663
01:55:33,067 --> 01:55:35,341
MARISHA: A romance novel.

1664
01:55:35,341 --> 01:55:36,710
MATT: Probably.

1665
01:55:36,710 --> 01:55:39,685
LAURA: Is Fabio on the cover?

1666
01:55:39,685 --> 01:55:45,645
LIAM: How's your trashy novel? Is it a good one? No
judgement.

1667
01:55:45,645 --> 01:55:50,997
MATT: "It's not trashy. It's very tasteful."

1668
01:55:50,997 --> 01:55:54,567
LIAM: Oh no, I'm fluent in Zemnian. I've read all
of his works.

1669
01:55:54,567 --> 01:55:55,735
MATT: "Have you?"

1670
01:55:55,735 --> 01:55:58,092
LIAM: Mutual fan.

1671
01:55:58,092 --> 01:56:02,457
MATT: "I didn't realize there was another Samuel
fan in here. Which is your favorite?"

1672
01:56:02,457 --> 01:56:04,796
LIAM: I love the Farthing's Embrace.

1673
01:56:04,796 --> 01:56:07,100
MATT: "I haven't read that one."

1674
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:11,626
LIAM: It's an early one. He actually did it under
a pseudonym. He did a whole series under that

1675
01:56:11,626 --> 01:56:13,344
pseudonym, short stories.

1676
01:56:13,344 --> 01:56:18,502
MATT: "What is it again?" He goes over and grabs a
piece of chalk in the back and starts, "It was--?"

1677
01:56:18,502 --> 01:56:21,784
LIAM: Farthing's Embrace.

1678
01:56:21,784 --> 01:56:30,784
MATT: "Mein Gott, I did not know about this. I may
have to send out Zadash and see if we can find

1679
01:56:30,784 --> 01:56:32,693
"some of those books. Thank you."

1680
01:56:32,693 --> 01:56:35,158
LIAM: You're a big reader or just Samuel?

1681
01:56:35,158 --> 01:56:39,600
MATT: "Just recently Samuel. I read on occasion.
It depends on what you can find."

1682
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:45,755
LIAM: I read a lot, but all I've been able to find
in this town is that parchment place.

1683
01:56:45,755 --> 01:56:48,872
MATT: "The parchment place is good for trash. If
you're looking for unique stuff, there's a few

1684
01:56:48,872 --> 01:56:50,275
"places you can go."

1685
01:56:50,275 --> 01:56:51,712
LIAM: Here in town?

1686
01:56:51,712 --> 01:56:57,612
MATT: "Here in town, yeah. If you're having a hard
time finding a specific book, I would recommend

1687
01:56:57,612 --> 01:57:00,211
"going to Burnished Bibelots."

1688
01:57:00,211 --> 01:57:02,452
LIAM: Burnished Bibelots. Which ward is that in?

1689
01:57:02,452 --> 01:57:07,396
MATT: "That is in the North Ward, just on the
outskirts of the main market street. It's a bit of

1690
01:57:07,396 --> 01:57:11,203
"a cluttered mess, but Oglen would be happy to help
you.

1691
01:57:11,203 --> 01:57:12,884
LIAM: Oglen?

1692
01:57:12,884 --> 01:57:15,457
MATT: "Oglen."

1693
01:57:15,457 --> 01:57:19,159
LIAM: That is good to know. Thank you.

1694
01:57:19,159 --> 01:57:21,784
MATT: "Not to worry."

1695
01:57:21,784 --> 01:57:26,815
LIAM: Those are hard to find, the Farthing's
Embrace.

1696
01:57:26,815 --> 01:57:30,783
MATT: "I imagine so. It can't be that bad."

1697
01:57:30,783 --> 01:57:33,766
LIAM: He wasn't as proud of them. Early work and
all that.

1698
01:57:33,766 --> 01:57:38,246
MATT: "Of course. I have a contact in Rexxentrum.
If I cannot find it in Zadash, I will get it from Rexxentrum."

1699
01:57:38,246 --> 01:57:40,261
LIAM: That would be the place.

1700
01:57:40,261 --> 01:57:41,893
MATT: "What's your name?"

1701
01:57:41,893 --> 01:57:43,320
LIAM: My name is Caleb.

1702
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:46,318
MATT: "Caleb. Pleasure to meet you. I am Vosna."

1703
01:57:46,318 --> 01:57:52,867
TRAVIS: Thank you for the drink, Vosna. I'll be
taking my leave now.

1704
01:57:52,867 --> 01:58:00,815
MATT: "Of course. If anybody else is a reader as
well, come by and talk sometime."

1705
01:58:00,815 --> 01:58:03,399
TALIESIN: Not there at all.

1706
01:58:03,399 --> 01:58:06,555
LIAM: This has been quite a day.

1707
01:58:06,555 --> 01:58:13,856
LAURA: Is there pictures?
(in high-pitched voice) Is there pictures?

1708
01:58:13,856 --> 01:58:17,103
MATT: "Pictures are up in here."

1709
01:58:17,103 --> 01:58:27,850
LAURA: Oh. Sounds exciting.

1710
01:58:27,850 --> 01:58:31,609
LIAM: I sneak my undrunk whiskey to Nott.

1711
01:58:31,609 --> 01:58:36,353
SAM: I take out my flask from my leg, unscrew it,
and pour it in.

1712
01:58:36,353 --> 01:58:40,747
MATT: Okay.

1713
01:58:40,747 --> 01:58:46,051
LAURA: What do you guys think? Should we stay
here? Should we go somewhere else?

1714
01:58:46,051 --> 01:58:48,963
TRAVIS: We got to get Molly.

1715
01:58:48,963 --> 01:58:50,983
TALIESIN: I just sat down for a moment with this
solitaire player.

1716
01:58:50,983 --> 01:58:55,640
MATT: Correct.

1717
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:59,805
TALIESIN: They say that solitaire is the game for
the death-obsessed. There's inevitability to every

1718
01:58:59,805 --> 01:59:07,666
hand, most of them are doomed from the start no
matter what you do. Any interest to buck fate and

1719
01:59:07,666 --> 01:59:19,833
try your hand at an opponent for once? No money,
just friendly.

1720
01:59:19,833 --> 01:59:22,806
I slide the rest of my whiskey over.

1721
01:59:22,806 --> 01:59:25,005
MATT: "Are you a devil?"

1722
01:59:25,005 --> 01:59:27,118
TALIESIN: I've been called worse.

1723
01:59:27,118 --> 01:59:29,828
MATT: "I don't play with devils."

1724
01:59:29,828 --> 01:59:35,599
TALIESIN: I'm just a man who saw another man die
yesterday. It's been heavy on my conscience and I

1725
01:59:35,599 --> 01:59:39,266
was just wondering if there was anything you could
tell me about Enon.

1726
01:59:39,266 --> 01:59:43,676
MATT: "Enon wanted to go to that bloody circus."

1727
01:59:43,676 --> 01:59:46,175
TALIESIN: I'm regretting it myself.

1728
01:59:46,175 --> 01:59:53,514
MATT: "I told him not to go. Stupid, it is for the
common folk and the young. He's always had his

1729
01:59:53,514 --> 01:59:55,405
"head in the clouds."

1730
01:59:55,405 --> 01:59:58,038
TALIESIN: Has he? That's not what other people
have said.

1731
01:59:58,038 --> 02:00:02,309
MATT: "Other people are stupid."

1732
02:00:02,309 --> 02:00:06,381
TALIESIN: Why do you think he went? Why do you
think that happened to him?

1733
02:00:06,381 --> 02:00:15,322
MATT: "He's lonely. Don't trust the carnival.
Nothing but spooks and magicians and things that

1734
02:00:15,322 --> 02:00:24,831
"want to take your life and take your money, take
your family, whisk you away. Fuck the circus."

1735
02:00:24,831 --> 02:00:35,484
TALIESIN: Fuck the circus. So that's what you
think happened to him, then? I feel like there's

1736
02:00:35,484 --> 02:00:38,983
something evil afoot.

1737
02:00:38,983 --> 02:00:41,805
MATT: "Says the devil."

1738
02:00:41,805 --> 02:00:46,110
TALIESIN: Again, I've been called worse. Sure you
have in your time, as well.

1739
02:00:46,110 --> 02:00:54,626
MATT: He takes the drink, sips it. "Don't come
'round here no more."

1740
02:00:54,626 --> 02:01:02,413
TALIESIN: I take my cup back. Down it. I love
small towns.

1741
02:01:02,413 --> 02:01:04,619
MARISHA: Shithead.

1742
02:01:04,619 --> 02:01:11,095
TRAVIS: We head outside. Well, that was
revealing.

1743
02:01:11,095 --> 02:01:12,487
SAM: Was it?

1744
02:01:12,487 --> 02:01:20,908
MARISHA: We learned a few things, actually. He's a
prime target. Perfect victim, perfect candidate.

1745
02:01:20,908 --> 02:01:26,899
No one really paid attention to him, he was old,
he had no family, his son's gone.

1746
02:01:26,899 --> 02:01:28,207
TALIESIN: Awfully convenient.

1747
02:01:28,207 --> 02:01:34,385
MARISHA: Awfully convenient. Still awfully
convenient that your little circus doesn't allow

1748
02:01:34,385 --> 02:01:39,462
the elderly, which you never fully explained, and
he happened to be one of the oldest people in that

1749
02:01:39,462 --> 02:01:46,594
circus. Where did that rule come from?
The sick makes sense, I asked you that

1750
02:01:46,594 --> 02:01:50,139
before, but why elderly?

1751
02:01:50,139 --> 02:01:53,489
TALIESIN: That rule's been around for as long as I
can remember because it makes people think the

1752
02:01:53,489 --> 02:01:58,875
show's dangerous. Gives them a thrill.

1753
02:01:58,875 --> 02:02:01,728
TRAVIS: You're worried about them having a heart
attack or something?

1754
02:02:01,728 --> 02:02:04,288
TALIESIN: We're not really worried about people
having a heart attack; we want people to be

1755
02:02:04,288 --> 02:02:08,761
worried about having a heart attack, because then
they're more excited to come see the show. This is

1756
02:02:08,761 --> 02:02:10,206
how these shows work.

1757
02:02:10,206 --> 02:02:12,396
MARISHA: Do you know who implemented that rule?

1758
02:02:12,396 --> 02:02:14,690
TALIESIN: Before my time.

1759
02:02:14,690 --> 02:02:20,877
LAURA: In his defense, every carnival I've gone to
has said no sick people, no old people.

1760
02:02:20,877 --> 02:02:24,094
TALIESIN: It's a boilerplate.

1761
02:02:24,094 --> 02:02:27,069
MARISHA: Still a good candidate.

1762
02:02:27,069 --> 02:02:30,908
TALIESIN: If you were trying to hide doing
something to someone it's a great candidate. If I

1763
02:02:30,908 --> 02:02:34,448
was trying to get away with something, terrible
idea.

1764
02:02:34,448 --> 02:02:41,030
MARISHA: Or if you were trying to frame someone.
Seems to be a lot of pretty bigoted people in this

1765
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:47,489
town who don't like tieflings and other strange
lots. Jester, you actually said one of the

1766
02:02:47,489 --> 02:02:57,500
smartest things of the night, which is-- you did,
yeah. Which is, guard's really weird.

1767
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:58,537
LAURA: Right?

1768
02:02:58,537 --> 02:02:59,773
MARISHA: Yeah.

1769
02:02:59,773 --> 02:03:00,979
TALIESIN: Wait, what?

1770
02:03:00,979 --> 02:03:02,506
LAURA: The guards are really weird.

1771
02:03:02,506 --> 02:03:06,065
MARISHA: The Crownsguards. As you were saying, the
Ustaloch?

1772
02:03:06,065 --> 02:03:07,493
TALIESIN: What kind of weird?

1773
02:03:07,493 --> 02:03:11,519
LAURA: Like, you know, they-- What kind of weird?

1774
02:03:11,519 --> 02:03:14,265
(laughter)

1775
02:03:14,265 --> 02:03:26,493
MARISHA: They seem to be the one connecting
through-line. Also, what's her name, Norda?

1776
02:03:26,493 --> 02:03:35,766
Mentioned that she didn't want to let you lot in,
but made an exception. I don't know, if I wanted

1777
02:03:35,766 --> 02:03:42,100
to do something, and if I already knew a bunch of
people were upset and angry at a circus and

1778
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:49,212
strange people coming in, it's easy framing, in my
opinion.

1779
02:03:49,212 --> 02:03:51,503
TRAVIS: She makes a valid point, actually.

1780
02:03:51,503 --> 02:03:57,420
LAURA. Oh. If people are scared of carnivals, they
won't want them in the future.

1781
02:03:57,420 --> 02:03:59,554
TRAVIS: Bingo.

1782
02:03:59,554 --> 02:04:05,134
MARISHA: That, or if you're up to no good and you
don't want to get caught, blame it on the easy

1783
02:04:05,134 --> 02:04:08,737
frame. The weirdos who just rolled into town.

1784
02:04:08,737 --> 02:04:13,501
LAURA: Great, so we just need to investigate the
guards.

1785
02:04:13,501 --> 02:04:16,537
TRAVIS: That might be harder to do. Maybe we go
down to the Lochward.

1786
02:04:16,537 --> 02:04:18,541
TALIESIN: Start at the docks, but I'll keep that
in mind.

1787
02:04:18,541 --> 02:04:20,944
MARISHA: I don't know, it might not be the
guards. There might be another through-line

1788
02:04:20,944 --> 02:04:22,287
that we're missing.

1789
02:04:22,287 --> 02:04:25,368
LAURA: Do we need to question the guards?

1790
02:04:25,368 --> 02:04:26,760
SAM: That sounds terrible.

1791
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:29,038
LAURA: Maybe we should tell them they can't leave
town.

1792
02:04:29,038 --> 02:04:33,380
MARISHA: Ooh, that's a good idea, yeah! Maybe when
they question us--

1793
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:34,689
LAURA: We turn it around!

1794
02:04:34,689 --> 02:04:36,162
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah!

1795
02:04:36,162 --> 02:04:37,435
MARISHA: I like that.

1796
02:04:37,435 --> 02:04:39,270
TALIESIN: I was about-- nope, nevermind.

1797
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:40,479
LAURA: What?

1798
02:04:40,479 --> 02:04:42,779
TALIESIN: I was about to be very impressed, but I
take it back.

1799
02:04:42,779 --> 02:04:47,082
MARISHA: Aw.

1800
02:04:47,082 --> 02:04:49,671
TRAVIS: How far is it from where we are to the
Lochward?

1801
02:04:49,671 --> 02:04:55,523
MATT: You guys are technically in the Lochward.
It's a quick jaunt over to the edge of the Ustaloch.

1802
02:04:55,523 --> 02:05:01,046
MARISHA: So the Ustaloch is the docks? It's what
they called the ward, or it's the lake?

1803
02:05:01,046 --> 02:05:04,038
MATT: It's the giant lake that the docks are up
against. The city is built against this giant,

1804
02:05:04,038 --> 02:05:05,712
kidney bean-shaped lake.

1805
02:05:05,712 --> 02:05:08,771
MARISHA: What does "usta" mean? What does "usta"
come from?

1806
02:05:08,771 --> 02:05:11,011
MATT: Do you speak Zemnian?

1807
02:05:11,011 --> 02:05:12,752
MARISHA: You speak Zemnian.

1808
02:05:12,752 --> 02:05:14,065
LIAM: I do speak Zemnian.

1809
02:05:14,065 --> 02:05:15,328
TALIESIN: What does "usta" mean?

1810
02:05:15,328 --> 02:05:17,025
LIAM: It means--

1811
02:05:17,025 --> 02:05:18,020
MATT: Do you know?

1812
02:05:18,020 --> 02:05:19,171
LIAM: Do I know?

1813
02:05:19,171 --> 02:05:21,170
MATT: I just wanted to fuck with you.

1814
02:05:21,170 --> 02:05:26,979
LIAM: It's been a while, but osten means lake. No,
it's not Lake Lake.

1815
02:05:26,979 --> 02:05:28,784
MATT: Essentially, it just means "an east lake."

1816
02:05:28,784 --> 02:05:31,159
LIAM and MARISHA: East Lake.

1817
02:05:31,159 --> 02:05:33,059
TALIESIN: Very good.

1818
02:05:33,059 --> 02:05:35,829
MATT: Not too complicated.

1819
02:05:35,829 --> 02:05:37,518
MARISHA: All right.

1820
02:05:37,518 --> 02:05:41,149
TALIESIN: I'd like to avoid the guards for as long
as possible.

1821
02:05:41,149 --> 02:05:42,161
MARISHA: Agreed.

1822
02:05:42,161 --> 02:05:48,291
TRAVIS: Let's head down to the docks. Keeping an
eye out for crownsguard.

1823
02:05:48,291 --> 02:05:53,935
MATT: As you guys make your way towards the
Ustaloch and the Dockward there, we'll go and take

1824
02:05:53,935 --> 02:05:58,520
a break. We'll be back in a few minutes. We'll
continue to unveil this mystery.

1825
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:01,514
SAM: This is exciting. Gripping.

1826
02:06:01,514 --> 02:06:10,106
MATT: Indeed. I suppose. Little low level mystery
here. We'll see where this goes. All right guys,

1827
02:06:10,106 --> 02:06:13,929
back here in a few minutes. We're going to take a
quick restroom break, pick it up from here. We

1828
02:06:13,929 --> 02:06:18,692
have video at the break for this week's contest,
so if you're watching on Twitch, feel free to go

1829
02:06:18,692 --> 02:06:23,112
ahead and pay attention to get the password and
enter this contest, and we'll have the victor at

1830
02:06:23,112 --> 02:06:28,137
the end of the break. We'll be back here in a few
minutes, and we'll see you then.

1831
02:06:28,137 --> 02:20:41,676
[break]

1832
02:20:41,676 --> 02:20:47,481
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. Before we dive in,
real fast, we do have a winner from the chat.

1833
02:20:47,481 --> 02:20:54,675
Thanks, Sam. Congratulations to AvilynRain,
AvilynRain in the Twitch chat! You won the awesome

1834
02:20:54,675 --> 02:20:59,331
Wyrmwood prize package. Danoba will be in contact
with you to get your contact information and get

1835
02:20:59,331 --> 02:21:02,676
that sent out to you. Congratulations.

1836
02:21:02,676 --> 02:21:07,322
MARISHA: I love how we just went through every
rain song in about 30 seconds.

1837
02:21:07,322 --> 02:21:14,666
MATT: Yeah we did! Most of them. As you guys make
your way across the streets of the Lochward, you

1838
02:21:14,666 --> 02:21:22,448
find yourself to the docks, which are about five
or six main dock structures that protrude anywhere

1839
02:21:22,448 --> 02:21:29,959
from ten to 30 or so feet into the loch itself.
There are no major ships. The biggest river that

1840
02:21:29,959 --> 02:21:33,851
exits the loch heads towards the mountains, so
there is no direct path to the inlet. All the

1841
02:21:33,851 --> 02:21:38,146
boats in here are small fishermen's boats; they're
designed specifically for the lake, for freshwater

1842
02:21:38,146 --> 02:21:45,460
fishing and whatever needs to be transferred from
bank to bank. As you approach, you can see a good

1843
02:21:45,460 --> 02:21:49,610
amount of the boats are still out on the water.
You can look out and see the outline of them

1844
02:21:49,610 --> 02:21:56,259
against the horizon. You see a couple of small
landmasses in the center of the loch, that are

1845
02:21:56,259 --> 02:22:04,962
barely out of view. You approach, and the first
couple of fishermen that walk past you both look

1846
02:22:04,962 --> 02:22:14,199
to be hardened in their years. Their skin is very
battered by the sun, it's wrinkled and dark from

1847
02:22:14,199 --> 02:22:20,620
constant beating of the sky upon them. They glance
over at this unique-looking troupe as they

1848
02:22:20,620 --> 02:22:25,111
approach. They stop and don't say anything, they
just look at you like "What are you doing here?"

1849
02:22:25,111 --> 02:22:26,905
LAURA: Do we still have Disguise Self up?

1850
02:22:26,905 --> 02:22:30,718
MATT: You have it for maybe ten more minutes.

1851
02:22:30,718 --> 02:22:34,019
MARISHA: Oh shit.

1852
02:22:34,019 --> 02:22:37,637
TRAVIS: Do we see any King's Guard? Crownsguard?

1853
02:22:37,637 --> 02:22:47,811
MATT: Crownsguard? Make a perception check.

1854
02:22:47,811 --> 02:22:49,810
LAURA: 11.

1855
02:22:49,810 --> 02:22:52,176
TRAVIS: 11, same.

1856
02:22:52,176 --> 02:22:55,388
MATT: Glancing about, you don't see any
crownsguard in the immediate vicinity of the

1857
02:22:55,388 --> 02:23:00,605
Lochward. You've seen them, they patrol the town
and walk through, ward to ward, but you don't see

1858
02:23:00,605 --> 02:23:03,576
any at the moment, no.

1859
02:23:03,576 --> 02:23:08,049
LAURA: Looks like we're ahead of them in the
investigation.

1860
02:23:08,049 --> 02:23:17,138
MARISHA: Hey, Jester. Do you happen to remember
the name of that guy whose daughter we saved from

1861
02:23:17,138 --> 02:23:18,584
the snake?

1862
02:23:18,584 --> 02:23:20,597
LAURA: Oh shit.

1863
02:23:20,597 --> 02:23:22,993
MARISHA: Yeah.

1864
02:23:22,993 --> 02:23:25,921
LAURA: Let's see if I wrote it down in my
sketchbook.

1865
02:23:25,921 --> 02:23:28,829
MARISHA: Yeah, because I didn't write it down.

1866
02:23:28,829 --> 02:23:30,376
LAURA: King Bertrand?

1867
02:23:30,376 --> 02:23:32,126
TRAVIS: No.

1868
02:23:32,126 --> 02:23:47,180
LAURA: Okay. What about-- no, I know that guy.
Nope, I didn't.

1869
02:23:47,180 --> 02:23:48,307
MARISHA: Damn it.

1870
02:23:48,307 --> 02:23:50,472
MATT: You remember where he lives, mostly, because
you were there.

1871
02:23:50,472 --> 02:23:52,064
MARISHA: That's true.

1872
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:53,516
LAURA: We could go by there.

1873
02:23:53,516 --> 02:23:56,351
MARISHA: We could go by. He seems to like us.

1874
02:23:56,351 --> 02:23:59,060
LAURA: He worked out there, right?

1875
02:23:59,060 --> 02:24:00,810
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.

1876
02:24:00,810 --> 02:24:08,225
MATT: You guys make your way along the edge of the
loch to the outside of the fisherman's house. The

1877
02:24:08,225 --> 02:24:15,224
house is currently being repaired. You can see in
the main doorway, the door is off the hinges, and

1878
02:24:15,224 --> 02:24:19,770
there's a large pile of ruined furniture and
cabinets that have been shifted out of the

1879
02:24:19,770 --> 02:24:30,549
building. You can also see a &lt;i>long&lt;/i> serpentine
body that is currently being skinned by a younger

1880
02:24:30,549 --> 02:24:35,524
man, probably 14 or 15. He's in the process of
carving the skin off of it. This thing is about 20

1881
02:24:35,524 --> 02:24:37,808
to 25 feet long.

1882
02:24:37,808 --> 02:24:39,468
MARISHA: That's the snake I punched.

1883
02:24:39,468 --> 02:24:42,860
LIAM: That's your work? That's impressive. You
took it all by yourself?

1884
02:24:42,860 --> 02:24:48,283
MARISHA: Well, no. They helped me. I'm not an
egomaniac. They fucking helped me.

1885
02:24:48,283 --> 02:24:54,264
LIAM: But I saw your guns last night. You probably
took the lead.

1886
02:24:54,264 --> 02:25:02,603
MARISHA: Give credit to the whole damn group, move
on.

1887
02:25:02,603 --> 02:25:06,028
TRAVIS: Flattery got you nowhere.

1888
02:25:06,028 --> 02:25:10,254
TALIESIN: I'm comparing the snake to the snake
that's tattooed on my hand to try and get the

1889
02:25:10,254 --> 02:25:13,837
heads to be the exact same size.

1890
02:25:13,837 --> 02:25:18,186
LIAM: We have been in the woods for too long. I've
forgotten how to talk to people.

1891
02:25:18,186 --> 02:25:21,533
SAM: Your game is really suffering.

1892
02:25:21,533 --> 02:25:24,608
MARISHA: Thanks for the damn compliment.

1893
02:25:24,608 --> 02:25:31,203
MATT: As you approach, the young man with this
large, sharpened knife-- it looks like it may have

1894
02:25:31,203 --> 02:25:36,870
been a heavy butchering knife that he's using to
fillet and pull the skin off the snake. Looks back

1895
02:25:36,870 --> 02:25:42,832
at you guys and doesn't know what's going on. You
hear a voice go, "Hey!" You look up and you see

1896
02:25:42,832 --> 02:25:45,734
the fisherman that you saw before, the one who
came to you guys in the tavern. He's up on top of

1897
02:25:45,734 --> 02:25:49,474
the roof, and he's currently boarding some
portions of it. It looks like a part of the roof

1898
02:25:49,474 --> 02:25:56,281
had been damaged in the fray. He goes, "Hold on,"
gets up, and comes down the ladder on the side and

1899
02:25:56,281 --> 02:26:02,153
approaches. You can see he's sweating. "I'm so
sorry, I didn't know you were coming. What can I

1900
02:26:02,153 --> 02:26:03,415
"do for you?"

1901
02:26:03,415 --> 02:26:05,647
MARISHA: Sorry for dropping in.

1902
02:26:05,647 --> 02:26:07,719
LAURA: Do we look like ourselves yet?

1903
02:26:07,719 --> 02:26:12,412
MATT: No, actually. This is an interesting point.

1904
02:26:12,412 --> 02:26:14,381
TRAVIS: Damn it.

1905
02:26:14,381 --> 02:26:16,288
SAM: Wait. None of you look the same.

1906
02:26:16,288 --> 02:26:20,238
MATT: That's right, no, thank you for reminding
me. He comes out and he goes, "How can I help

1907
02:26:20,238 --> 02:26:21,183
"you?"

1908
02:26:21,183 --> 02:26:23,876
(laughter)

1909
02:26:23,876 --> 02:26:26,317
LAURA: It's us!

1910
02:26:26,317 --> 02:26:35,635
MARISHA: Yeah, it's me. I pull the hat off and
pull my hair up. It's Beauregard. We killed your

1911
02:26:35,635 --> 02:26:39,457
snake?

1912
02:26:39,457 --> 02:26:43,649
LAURA: (in normal voice) Pretend that I don't
talk-- (in human accent) Pretend that I don't talk

1913
02:26:43,649 --> 02:26:44,546
like this.

1914
02:26:44,546 --> 02:26:47,438
TRAVIS: Fuck it, I drop Disguise Self.

1915
02:26:47,438 --> 02:26:49,333
MATT: He goes,"Ah!"

1916
02:26:49,333 --> 02:26:52,219
TRAVIS: I'm sorry to deceive you.

1917
02:26:52,219 --> 02:26:54,397
MATT: I'm very confused.

1918
02:26:54,397 --> 02:26:59,752
MARISHA: Oh no. Don't worry about it. What was
your name, friend?

1919
02:26:59,752 --> 02:27:00,768
MATT: "Rinaldo."

1920
02:27:00,768 --> 02:27:06,185
MARISHA: Rinaldo! That's what it was. I knew it
was an R! Okay, Rinaldo.

1921
02:27:06,185 --> 02:27:09,743
TRAVIS: Rinaldo, this snake that was in your house
is not the only strange occurrence that's been

1922
02:27:09,743 --> 02:27:13,641
happening. We're trying to find out the cause of
it. Have you seen anything else like this in the

1923
02:27:13,641 --> 02:27:16,736
time that's passed?

1924
02:27:16,736 --> 02:27:20,270
MATT: "No, we've been doing repairs on the house
and getting everything underway. This is the first

1925
02:27:20,270 --> 02:27:26,376
"thing that's come on this side. Most of them live
toward the center of the lake and stay underwater.

1926
02:27:26,376 --> 02:27:30,648
"It's been two in the last few months that have
come up. It's a bit of a nuisance."

1927
02:27:30,648 --> 02:27:33,602
LAURA: Have you seen any zombies coming out of the
lake?

1928
02:27:33,602 --> 02:27:36,772
MATT: "Zombies? What are you talking about?"

1929
02:27:36,772 --> 02:27:41,397
TRAVIS: We're asking after a man that helped down
at the docks, named Enon. Have you heard of him?

1930
02:27:41,397 --> 02:27:42,558
MATT: "Enon?"

1931
02:27:42,558 --> 02:27:43,746
TRAVIS: Enon.

1932
02:27:43,746 --> 02:27:48,922
MATT: "Yeah, I worked with him a couple times. He
comes through, looking for work, asking to see

1933
02:27:48,922 --> 02:27:50,114
what's available."

1934
02:27:50,114 --> 02:27:57,200
LIAM: You obviously have not heard the news from
the traveling circus in town. From last night.

1935
02:27:57,200 --> 02:27:59,184
MATT: "No. That's the big blue tent, right?"

1936
02:27:59,184 --> 02:28:00,354
LIAM: That's correct.

1937
02:28:00,354 --> 02:28:01,977
MATT: "No, what's going on?"

1938
02:28:01,977 --> 02:28:03,917
LAURA: (whispering) Enon turned into a zombie.

1939
02:28:03,917 --> 02:28:04,968
SAM: What?

1940
02:28:04,968 --> 02:28:08,915
LAURA: (louder) Enon turned into a zombie!
(whispering) And was killed.

1941
02:28:08,915 --> 02:28:11,459
SAM: What?

1942
02:28:11,459 --> 02:28:20,127
MATT: "I'm sorry to hear that. That's terrible.
Wow, that's really terrible. I'm sorry."

1943
02:28:20,127 --> 02:28:23,467
TRAVIS: We were trying to see if he might have
worked with people that might have known what he

1944
02:28:23,467 --> 02:28:26,075
was doing that day, earlier.

1945
02:28:26,075 --> 02:28:29,111
MATT: "I haven't seen him at the docks in a while.
Not for a week, at least."

1946
02:28:29,111 --> 02:28:30,602
TRAVIS and LAURA: Really?

1947
02:28:30,602 --> 02:28:36,408
LIAM: Is there anything out of the ordinary from
the past week or two that comes to mind? Anything

1948
02:28:36,408 --> 02:28:38,978
off about the run-of-the-mill stuff?

1949
02:28:38,978 --> 02:28:47,792
MATT: "Other than a giant fucking snake ruining my
house, but not that comes to mind, no. Circus

1950
02:28:47,792 --> 02:28:51,052
"coming into town, that's a little weird."

1951
02:28:51,052 --> 02:28:54,576
TRAVIS: I see you're skinning the beast. Can I ask
why?

1952
02:28:54,576 --> 02:28:59,209
MATT: "I'm not going to let it go to waste. That's
some good meat. Some good skin."

1953
02:28:59,209 --> 02:29:04,730
MARISHA: You mentioned the circus coming to town
as weird. Why?

1954
02:29:04,730 --> 02:29:08,144
MATT: "Because there's a circus in town."

1955
02:29:08,144 --> 02:29:10,117
LIAM: He just means out of the ordinary, yeah?

1956
02:29:10,117 --> 02:29:15,822
MATT: "Yeah. We don't get many shows and traveling
folk. Last time this was here, a year ago, it came

1957
02:29:15,822 --> 02:29:19,181
"and went in a week."

1958
02:29:19,181 --> 02:29:25,531
SAM: You said you hadn't seen this-- hi. You said
you hadn't seen this person in a week? Was that

1959
02:29:25,531 --> 02:29:27,662
unusual?

1960
02:29:27,662 --> 02:29:33,507
MATT: "No. I didn't keep up with him. He came
through every now and then. I had a little cash

1961
02:29:33,507 --> 02:29:39,255
"and needed some help hauling things around. I
asked for his assistance. He was an old fella, and

1962
02:29:39,255 --> 02:29:45,952
"it was less that he was helpful and more that we
wanted to help when we could."

1963
02:29:45,952 --> 02:29:49,424
TRAVIS: If we went down to the docks where he
worked, is there anyone that we should ask for, to

1964
02:29:49,424 --> 02:29:52,493
speak to, who might have known him better?

1965
02:29:52,493 --> 02:29:57,515
MATT: "Your guess is as good as mine. To be fair,
although we're a community, we're also relatively

1966
02:29:57,515 --> 02:30:02,096
"competitive. You understand."

1967
02:30:02,096 --> 02:30:04,002
TRAVIS: I do.

1968
02:30:04,002 --> 02:30:07,945
TALIESIN: You think anyone would have wanted him
marked or harmed in some way?

1969
02:30:07,945 --> 02:30:16,659
MATT: "I don't think so. He's an old man. I
haven't seen or heard anyone-- his disposition

1970
02:30:16,659 --> 02:30:24,486
"seemed positive enough, if a little sad and
lonely."

1971
02:30:24,486 --> 02:30:28,949
TRAVIS: If you think of anything, or if you hear
anyone speak about him, you can find us at the

1972
02:30:28,949 --> 02:30:33,436
Nestled Nook Inn. We'd appreciate anything, if it
happens to reach your ears.

1973
02:30:33,436 --> 02:30:38,597
MATT: "Of course. Let me finish up here with the
roof and I'll ask around, see if anything comes up."

1974
02:30:38,597 --> 02:30:40,117
TRAVIS: Much obliged.

1975
02:30:40,117 --> 02:30:48,513
MARISHA: How's your little girl doing? Sorry, I
cover my beard.

1976
02:30:48,513 --> 02:30:50,833
MATT: "It just wasn't expected."

1977
02:30:50,833 --> 02:30:52,176
MARISHA: Sorry.

1978
02:30:52,176 --> 02:30:57,817
MATT: "No, she's doing great. She's been a little
spooked, but she slept well last night. She's

1979
02:30:57,817 --> 02:31:03,889
"doing fine. Thank you again for what you guys did
for me."

1980
02:31:03,889 --> 02:31:06,503
LAURA: You're welcome.

1981
02:31:06,503 --> 02:31:11,032
SAM: What? For what?

1982
02:31:11,032 --> 02:31:12,659
LAURA: We saved a little girl!

1983
02:31:12,659 --> 02:31:14,539
SAM: Oh yes, that's right.

1984
02:31:14,539 --> 02:31:19,790
LAURA: If you see any zombies, please let us
know.

1985
02:31:19,790 --> 02:31:23,636
MATT: "I will. You were so kind to help me when I
saw a snake, I figure if I see a zombie, you'd

1986
02:31:23,636 --> 02:31:24,875
"also be helpful."

1987
02:31:24,875 --> 02:31:29,703
LAURA: We would, definitely. We already killed a
zombie too!

1988
02:31:29,703 --> 02:31:33,557
TALIESIN: This is just a snake. This is a big,
weird snake I'm looking at?

1989
02:31:33,557 --> 02:31:35,399
MATT: You can inspect it if you want.

1990
02:31:35,399 --> 02:31:37,138
TALIESIN: No, I've been looking at the snake this
entire time.

1991
02:31:37,138 --> 02:31:39,870
LAURA: Oh, we have one of its fangs. I pulled it
out.

1992
02:31:39,870 --> 02:31:41,936
MATT: Make a nature check.

1993
02:31:41,936 --> 02:31:43,923
SAM: Ooh, don't do those much either.

1994
02:31:43,923 --> 02:31:48,219
MARISHA: I have a fang too, right?

1995
02:31:48,219 --> 02:31:49,879
TALIESIN: Nine.

1996
02:31:49,879 --> 02:31:53,968
MATT: Nine? You don't know much about snake
biology. It's hard to tell if it's out of the

1997
02:31:53,968 --> 02:31:56,692
ordinary. It's just a big snake.

1998
02:31:56,692 --> 02:31:58,168
TALIESIN: Looks like mine.

1999
02:31:58,168 --> 02:31:59,055
LAURA: Only bigger.

2000
02:31:59,055 --> 02:32:01,541
TALIESIN: Much bigger.

2001
02:32:01,541 --> 02:32:03,139
TRAVIS: Shall we?

2002
02:32:03,139 --> 02:32:04,847
LAURA: Fuck. Sure.

2003
02:32:04,847 --> 02:32:08,956
SAM: We are the best detectives ever.

2004
02:32:08,956 --> 02:32:11,932
LAURA: I feel like we are really doing bad at this
detective thing.

2005
02:32:11,932 --> 02:32:15,165
TRAVIS: We should probably wrap up whatever we're
doing. I imagine they're going to come by the inn

2006
02:32:15,165 --> 02:32:18,054
soon and try and speak with us. Not you two.

2007
02:32:18,054 --> 02:32:21,238
SAM: We didn't leave any sort of Ferris Bueller-y
thing?

2008
02:32:21,238 --> 02:32:29,465
TRAVIS: Nope. No stuffed beds, no recordings on
the old VHS.

2009
02:32:29,465 --> 02:32:31,771
MATT: What are you guys doing? Where are you
going?

2010
02:32:31,771 --> 02:32:36,094
SAM: Is there anywhere else that we need to
inspect? The carnival or more docks stuff?

2011
02:32:36,094 --> 02:32:39,248
LAURA: I feel like going back to the carnival is
probably a bad idea.

2012
02:32:39,248 --> 02:32:42,445
TALIESIN: I'd say the docks are his home, if we
could figure out where he lived.

2013
02:32:42,445 --> 02:32:44,341
SAM: Where he was last seen.

2014
02:32:44,341 --> 02:32:46,341
TALIESIN: He was last seen at the circus!

2015
02:32:46,341 --> 02:32:48,385
LAURA: Rinaldo!

2016
02:32:48,385 --> 02:32:49,668
MATT: "Yeah?"

2017
02:32:49,668 --> 02:32:54,264
LAURA: Do you know where Enon lives?

2018
02:32:54,264 --> 02:33:01,683
MATT: "I can't say I do. I'm sorry. My apologies.
Wish I could be of more help."

2019
02:33:01,683 --> 02:33:04,368
LAURA: It's okay.

2020
02:33:04,368 --> 02:33:07,761
TALIESIN: You don't happen to know what happened
to his son, by any chance?

2021
02:33:07,761 --> 02:33:10,808
MATT: "I didn't even know he had a son."

2022
02:33:10,808 --> 02:33:13,397
LAURA: See? We're better investigators than this
guy.

2023
02:33:13,397 --> 02:33:18,164
SAM: But he's not trying to investigate!

2024
02:33:18,164 --> 02:33:21,208
TALIESIN: I take the compliment. I'm putting it my
pocket. I'm keeping it for later.

2025
02:33:21,208 --> 02:33:23,313
MATT: He climbs back up the ladder to the roof.

2026
02:33:23,313 --> 02:33:26,950
MARISHA: I'm starting to think that following
Enon's story isn't necessarily going to lead us

2027
02:33:26,950 --> 02:33:31,248
here. He seems like a random victim.

2028
02:33:31,248 --> 02:33:34,411
LAURA: Hey, 14 year old kid!

2029
02:33:34,411 --> 02:33:41,972
MATT: He has this puffy red 'fro going on. He
looks pale, fresh to this, scrawny. He's stopped

2030
02:33:41,972 --> 02:33:46,611
drawing his blade across the snake. "Yeah?"

2031
02:33:46,611 --> 02:33:48,075
LAURA: Do you live here?

2032
02:33:48,075 --> 02:33:50,676
MATT: "No, I live about three houses up."

2033
02:33:50,676 --> 02:33:52,397
LAURA: Did you go to the carnival?

2034
02:33:52,397 --> 02:33:53,958
MATT: "Last night? Yeah, I was there."

2035
02:33:53,958 --> 02:33:56,351
LAURA: Okay, where were you at the carnival?

2036
02:33:56,351 --> 02:34:00,954
MATT: "I actually snuck in under the tent after it
had started."

2037
02:34:00,954 --> 02:34:09,513
LAURA: Right, that's a good thing. Were you close
to Enon? In the show. Were you on that side or the

2038
02:34:09,513 --> 02:34:13,768
other side? Did you see the zombie?

2039
02:34:13,768 --> 02:34:18,456
MATT: "I saw him a little bit. He was in the front
and I had people in front of me, but I think I saw

2040
02:34:18,456 --> 02:34:20,531
"some of it. It was pretty cool."

2041
02:34:20,531 --> 02:34:26,914
LAURA: It was kind of crazy, right? Have you heard
any ghost stories around town lately? About scary

2042
02:34:26,914 --> 02:34:30,716
things happening?

2043
02:34:30,716 --> 02:34:39,179
MATT: "My grandma told me a ghost story years ago
about these giant badger creatures that live on

2044
02:34:39,179 --> 02:34:44,548
"the hills of the Ashkeeper that can stand up on
their hind legs, and they come down and they eat

2045
02:34:44,548 --> 02:34:46,980
"kids that don't go to bed in time."

2046
02:34:46,980 --> 02:34:53,952
LAURA: Oh shit. Those guys are scary, I've heard
of them. You should be really careful. Have you

2047
02:34:53,952 --> 02:34:56,865
heard anything about zombies?

2048
02:34:56,865 --> 02:35:02,109
MATT: "No, not since that."

2049
02:35:02,109 --> 02:35:04,298
LIAM: What's up?

2050
02:35:04,298 --> 02:35:09,059
LAURA: Caleb has seen some shit.

2051
02:35:09,059 --> 02:35:11,361
MATT: "I have to finish the--"

2052
02:35:11,361 --> 02:35:15,683
LAURA: Hey, listen, if you hear any other ghost
stories, you come and find us, okay?

2053
02:35:15,683 --> 02:35:16,443
MATT: "Okay."

2054
02:35:16,443 --> 02:35:18,007
LAURA: All right.

2055
02:35:18,007 --> 02:35:20,612
(laughter)

2056
02:35:20,612 --> 02:35:23,798
MARISHA: Are we just going from person to person
in town telling them to come find us?

2057
02:35:23,798 --> 02:35:26,027
SAM: We are really terrible at this!

2058
02:35:26,027 --> 02:35:29,038
TALIESIN: Well, she's making friends with
everybody. I don't see any of you making friends.

2059
02:35:29,038 --> 02:35:31,156
TRAVIS: I'm a little concerned that we've been
gone for a while.

2060
02:35:31,156 --> 02:35:32,724
MARISHA: Yeah, maybe we should get back.

2061
02:35:32,724 --> 02:35:35,412
TRAVIS: Maybe let these two, that aren't under
house arrest--

2062
02:35:35,412 --> 02:35:39,261
SAM: Continue the investigation? Or go back?

2063
02:35:39,261 --> 02:35:44,034
TRAVIS: No, continue. I mean, if you're up for
it.

2064
02:35:44,034 --> 02:35:46,066
SAM: Yeah, yeah, We'll be a regular--

2065
02:35:46,066 --> 02:35:50,887
LIAM: Yeah, we've done nothing wrong. We're not
sweating it. I'm not sweating--

2066
02:35:50,887 --> 02:35:56,234
LAURA: Yeah, I believe you completely. That was
very believable. I'm going to give you another

2067
02:35:56,234 --> 02:35:57,791
blessing before you leave, okay?

2068
02:35:57,791 --> 02:36:01,472
LIAM: What are you talking about? None of us did
anything. None of us! We protected the people of

2069
02:36:01,472 --> 02:36:02,623
this town!

2070
02:36:02,623 --> 02:36:03,612
LAURA: It's true.

2071
02:36:03,612 --> 02:36:04,635
LIAM: It is true.

2072
02:36:04,635 --> 02:36:05,435
LAURA: I know.

2073
02:36:05,435 --> 02:36:09,140
LIAM: That's easy. Let's go solve a mystery,
Nott.

2074
02:36:09,140 --> 02:36:10,569
SAM: All right.

2075
02:36:10,569 --> 02:36:15,034
TALIESIN: Were you being sarcastic-- oh, no you
weren't, okay. Catching up on that.

2076
02:36:15,034 --> 02:36:21,424
MARISHA: So, kids don't know anything about this,
old people don't know anything about this--

2077
02:36:21,424 --> 02:36:23,987
TRAVIS: Tavern-keeper doesn't know anything about
this.

2078
02:36:23,987 --> 02:36:29,815
TALIESIN: Only the pure of heart make their answer
out of riddles. Back to the tavern.

2079
02:36:29,815 --> 02:36:36,879
MARISHA: But pure of heart! Still going back to
the guards thing! Back to the tavern, let's go.

2080
02:36:36,879 --> 02:36:40,252
SAM: Were we just on the docks?

2081
02:36:40,252 --> 02:36:42,300
MATT: Yeah, you guys were at the docks.

2082
02:36:42,300 --> 02:36:43,717
LIAM: We came up with bupkus.

2083
02:36:43,717 --> 02:36:46,090
LAURA: We didn't ask anybody, we went straight to
the house.

2084
02:36:46,090 --> 02:36:48,191
SAM: Okay, we'll walk around the docks and look
for--

2085
02:36:48,191 --> 02:36:50,501
TRAVIS: We'll see you back at the inn.

2086
02:36:50,501 --> 02:36:52,972
SAM: All right.

2087
02:36:52,972 --> 02:36:56,617
LAURA: Should we run back, or should we saunter
back?

2088
02:36:56,617 --> 02:37:00,579
TALIESIN: You're going to probably, you know,
poof.

2089
02:37:00,579 --> 02:37:02,093
MARISHA: Yeah, how much time does she have?

2090
02:37:02,093 --> 02:37:03,643
LIAM: About a minute?

2091
02:37:03,643 --> 02:37:05,584
MATT: Yeah, it's about to fade.

2092
02:37:05,584 --> 02:37:08,606
LAURA: Yeah, I figured it had already happened
probably midway talking to the kid.

2093
02:37:08,606 --> 02:37:10,441
MATT: Probably.

2094
02:37:10,441 --> 02:37:14,317
MARISHA: Maybe super stealthily back?

2095
02:37:14,317 --> 02:37:17,176
LAURA: All right. I put my hood up.

2096
02:37:17,176 --> 02:37:20,890
TALIESIN: I can maybe put a rope through the
window.

2097
02:37:20,890 --> 02:37:23,802
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a good idea.

2098
02:37:23,802 --> 02:37:26,594
LAURA: Is it a two-story?

2099
02:37:26,594 --> 02:37:28,754
MATT: It's a two-story. You guys are up in the
second story.

2100
02:37:28,754 --> 02:37:30,180
TALIESIN: I got rope.

2101
02:37:30,180 --> 02:37:33,194
LAURA: Let's do that, yeah. We'll sneak around the
back of the inn, and try to climb up the upstairs

2102
02:37:33,194 --> 02:37:34,220
window.

2103
02:37:34,220 --> 02:37:36,014
TRAVIS: I can keep them busy at the front door.

2104
02:37:36,014 --> 02:37:38,453
TALIESIN: I'll go through the front like a proper
person.

2105
02:37:38,453 --> 02:37:47,462
MATT: All right, so you guys are setting up a rope
to climb up the back? You go in, on your own, up

2106
02:37:47,462 --> 02:37:48,853
to the top, you put a rope through--

2107
02:37:48,853 --> 02:37:50,180
MARISHA: Fjord's distracting.

2108
02:37:50,180 --> 02:37:52,865
LAURA: In the front. Then we're going to try to
sneak--

2109
02:37:52,865 --> 02:37:56,281
TALIESIN: Right, and then I'm going to drop some
of the rope out the back window for them.

2110
02:37:56,281 --> 02:38:00,220
MATT: Easy enough to do, so those of you who want
to wait and can take the rope up, you wait for a

2111
02:38:00,220 --> 02:38:07,710
moment where nobody's watching and climb your way
up into the inn safely and get to your rooms. You

2112
02:38:07,710 --> 02:38:09,158
two, what are you doing?

2113
02:38:09,158 --> 02:38:11,638
TALIESIN: (singing) 50 feet of hemp rope, it's a
standard!

2114
02:38:11,638 --> 02:38:13,834
LIAM: Hey kiddo, do you want a piggy-back?

2115
02:38:13,834 --> 02:38:15,713
SAM: Sure, that sounds like a good idea.

2116
02:38:15,713 --> 02:38:17,816
LIAM: Scramble up, let's go talk to some people.

2117
02:38:17,816 --> 02:38:19,547
SAM: All right, I'll jump on Caleb's back.

2118
02:38:19,547 --> 02:38:22,566
MATT: All right.

2119
02:38:22,566 --> 02:38:26,655
LIAM: I'll wander down to where people are
working. Where people are moving crates around.

2120
02:38:26,655 --> 02:38:28,536
MARISHA: He's on Caleb's back!

2121
02:38:28,536 --> 02:38:32,175
MATT: Okay, that would be probably closer to the
Northward.

2122
02:38:32,175 --> 02:38:37,106
LIAM: Okay, so that's the plan, is to look for
people moving crap around, the same way that Enon

2123
02:38:37,106 --> 02:38:41,606
is said to have. So that's what we'll do.

2124
02:38:41,606 --> 02:38:42,711
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

2125
02:38:42,711 --> 02:38:43,707
LIAM: All right.

2126
02:38:43,707 --> 02:38:44,906
SAM: Shall I help, or no?

2127
02:38:44,906 --> 02:38:47,244
MATT: If you want to.

2128
02:38:47,244 --> 02:38:48,790
LIAM: Not that great.

2129
02:38:48,790 --> 02:38:53,326
MATT: You aiding him would give him an advantage
in the roll.

2130
02:38:53,326 --> 02:38:58,817
LIAM: Oh! That didn't help. 12 for me.

2131
02:38:58,817 --> 02:39:06,289
MATT: You take a couple hours wandering through
the Northward, asking questions, and most of the

2132
02:39:06,289 --> 02:39:13,823
information you get is, they have no idea who that
is, or like, "Ah, he died? It's about time."

2133
02:39:13,823 --> 02:39:19,552
LIAM: And there's no point even asking questions
because we've asked them all for two hours, yeah?

2134
02:39:19,552 --> 02:39:22,724
MATT: I'd say yeah, based on that roll.

2135
02:39:22,724 --> 02:39:28,814
LIAM: Okay, well that's a big zero. You want to go
book shopping with me?

2136
02:39:28,814 --> 02:39:29,887
SAM: Sure!

2137
02:39:29,887 --> 02:39:37,938
LIAM: Okay. I believe that gentleman said that the
Burnished Bibliots was in the Northward, correct?

2138
02:39:37,938 --> 02:39:43,022
MATT: I believe you are correct. Yeah, it's in the
southern portion of the Northward by where it

2139
02:39:43,022 --> 02:39:44,568
borders the Lochward.

2140
02:39:44,568 --> 02:39:47,255
LIAM: Okay, so I'll start asking questions to get
us there.

2141
02:39:47,255 --> 02:39:53,020
MATT: Easily enough. You eventually are led to it,
and you come to a closet that's affixed to another

2142
02:39:53,020 --> 02:40:02,363
building. The wood used are almost driftwood and
heavily weathered, and the front door is closed as

2143
02:40:02,363 --> 02:40:10,459
you approach. It looks like a glorified storage
shed that has been bolted and put up against

2144
02:40:10,459 --> 02:40:15,609
another structure.

2145
02:40:15,609 --> 02:40:18,833
LIAM: All right, well I will walk up to the door
and knock on it.

2146
02:40:18,833 --> 02:40:22,460
MATT: Okay. (knocks) No response.

2147
02:40:22,460 --> 02:40:32,774
LIAM: Is there any breaks in the door or the
building or cracks that Frumpkin could fit into?

2148
02:40:32,774 --> 02:40:35,929
MATT: Visual glance, there look like there's that
space underneath the door.

2149
02:40:35,929 --> 02:40:38,627
Probably not enough for a cat to slip through.

2150
02:40:38,627 --> 02:40:42,259
LIAM: Are there any windows or anything or is it
all a big, dirty, dingy mess?

2151
02:40:42,259 --> 02:40:46,586
MATT: There are windows, but if you look at the
back of the windows all you see is scraps of

2152
02:40:46,586 --> 02:40:54,647
material, stacks of books, piles of boxes and
crates, it's literally blocked out with things

2153
02:40:54,647 --> 02:40:56,810
stacked up against it from the interior.

2154
02:40:56,810 --> 02:40:59,344
LIAM: How busy is the front of this place?

2155
02:40:59,344 --> 02:41:02,630
MATT: Not busy at all, it's just the two of you,
right now, standing at the front door.

2156
02:41:02,630 --> 02:41:05,168
LIAM: No one's around us, though?

2157
02:41:05,168 --> 02:41:09,978
MATT: It's not on the main street, it's a little
pushed back, recessed about ten or 15 feet from

2158
02:41:09,978 --> 02:41:13,869
the main road so there's no one immediately around
you. But there are people walking back and forth

2159
02:41:13,869 --> 02:41:19,148
on the road behind but you're out in the open, per
se.

2160
02:41:19,148 --> 02:41:21,122
SAM: And no one's coming to the door?

2161
02:41:21,122 --> 02:41:22,891
MATT: No one's come to the door yet, no.

2162
02:41:22,891 --> 02:41:25,522
SAM: Want me to break in?

2163
02:41:25,522 --> 02:41:28,231
LIAM: Yes. No.

2164
02:41:28,231 --> 02:41:30,620
[knocking]

2165
02:41:30,620 --> 02:41:43,384
MATT: Okay. A moment passes and you hear, "Hold
on!" The door opens. It was open. There's the

2166
02:41:43,384 --> 02:41:50,234
sound of heavy sacks go tumbling down to the
interior of it and you glance around and you hear

2167
02:41:50,234 --> 02:41:53,468
a voice go, "Can I help you?"

2168
02:41:53,468 --> 02:41:54,671
LIAM: Hello?

2169
02:41:54,671 --> 02:41:59,881
MATT: You look down, and there's this
crotchety-looking scrawny old gnome who's sitting

2170
02:41:59,881 --> 02:42:06,771
there in the doorway. He's got this vibrant puff,
like a cotton ball, of hair around his head. But

2171
02:42:06,771 --> 02:42:13,514
it's this perfect "U" of bald on top. No glasses,
eyes are very small and beady, and he has this

2172
02:42:13,514 --> 02:42:18,333
bulbous, round nose at the front with this little
bit of a tuft of chin white hair that matches the

2173
02:42:18,333 --> 02:42:23,147
cotton ball tuft on the sides. He's sitting there
clutching the top of the knob on the inside which

2174
02:42:23,147 --> 02:42:28,840
is actually affixed shorter on the door and he
goes, "Well come in."

2175
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:31,110
LIAM: Yes please, you're open for business I take
it.

2176
02:42:31,110 --> 02:42:33,298
MATT: "Always open, come on in."

2177
02:42:33,298 --> 02:42:34,415
LIAM: All right.

2178
02:42:34,415 --> 02:42:38,379
MATT: Turns around and musters his way inside. As
soon as you step in the door and look around, this

2179
02:42:38,379 --> 02:42:44,695
place looks like an episode of Hoarders. It is
just floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall, stacks of

2180
02:42:44,695 --> 02:42:52,052
anything and everything: knick-knacks, small
stuffed animals, toys, books, glasses, and

2181
02:42:52,052 --> 02:43:03,618
goblets. It is the biggest, crammed flea-market
into a small shed-like space you've seen.

2182
02:43:03,618 --> 02:43:05,720
SAM: I start unscrewing my flask.

2183
02:43:05,720 --> 02:43:11,252
(laughing)

2184
02:43:11,252 --> 02:43:19,363
LIAM: Frumpkin climbs back up onto Nott's shoulder
and nestles in.

2185
02:43:19,363 --> 02:43:24,702
MATT: (meowing)

2186
02:43:24,702 --> 02:43:30,106
LIAM: I am scouting the city for books, I am
starved for books.

2187
02:43:30,106 --> 02:43:31,753
MATT: "Well we've got books here."

2188
02:43:31,753 --> 02:43:34,439
LIAM: Yes sir, I'm sorry what is your name?

2189
02:43:34,439 --> 02:43:38,135
MATT: "Oglen. Oglen Hornsblower."

2190
02:43:38,135 --> 02:43:39,700
LIAM: Oglen Hornsblower.

2191
02:43:39,700 --> 02:43:44,729
MATT: "And welcome to my collection. You want to
buy something, let me know."

2192
02:43:44,729 --> 02:43:50,512
LIAM: Well I see you sell a great many things in
here, books included. This is just things you've

2193
02:43:50,512 --> 02:43:52,268
collected throughout your lifetime?

2194
02:43:52,268 --> 02:43:55,521
MATT: "Right. Boughten, traded for, found."

2195
02:43:55,521 --> 02:44:03,379
LIAM: I don't know what you just said, but I am
interested in books. Particularly in the arcane

2196
02:44:03,379 --> 02:44:10,307
realm, but any kind of book. Do you have anything
that you just outright know is out of the

2197
02:44:10,307 --> 02:44:11,713
ordinary?

2198
02:44:11,713 --> 02:44:17,139
MATT: "I'm sure we've got a few. Look around! See
what you find. It's half the fun, half the

2199
02:44:17,139 --> 02:44:18,753
"journey."

2200
02:44:18,753 --> 02:44:29,438
LIAM: All right, friend, let's-- It's like
Winter's Crest morning for me and I'm scanning the

2201
02:44:29,438 --> 02:44:30,485
shelves.

2202
02:44:30,485 --> 02:44:32,557
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2203
02:44:32,557 --> 02:44:37,941
SAM: Can you give me something to look for? To
distract me and give me a mission to go on,

2204
02:44:37,941 --> 02:44:39,556
please?

2205
02:44:39,556 --> 02:44:48,257
LIAM: Yes. You want to find some sort of tool that
helps you do what you do best.

2206
02:44:48,257 --> 02:44:52,799
SAM: All right.

2207
02:44:52,799 --> 02:44:56,131
LIAM: Investigation check, that is a 21.

2208
02:44:56,131 --> 02:44:57,603
MATT: 21?

2209
02:44:57,603 --> 02:45:04,532
SAM: I rolled a 21 investigation check.

2210
02:45:04,532 --> 02:45:05,903
MATT: All right.

2211
02:45:05,903 --> 02:45:09,505
SAM: I'm just looking for baubles to steal.

2212
02:45:09,505 --> 02:45:12,727
(laughter)

2213
02:45:12,727 --> 02:45:19,638
MATT: All right. In thumbing through, there are
plenty of books that, within a first glance,

2214
02:45:19,638 --> 02:45:23,735
"This is not of interest to me." You have to move things
out of the way and push things aside.

2215
02:45:23,735 --> 02:45:28,040
The smell in there is dusty and moldy 
and you do find there is

2216
02:45:28,040 --> 02:45:30,762
some subtle water damage and some mildew growing

2217
02:45:30,762 --> 02:45:36,370
in one far corner and you're like ugh, put that
back. However, you rolled really high. Two things

2218
02:45:36,370 --> 02:45:42,481
catch your eye. One, there appears to be the
remnants of some sort of notebook, a sketchbook

2219
02:45:42,481 --> 02:45:46,684
that is written in a language you do not
understand-- What languages do you know?

2220
02:45:46,684 --> 02:45:54,085
LIAM: Well, off the bat, I don't know where that
is in D&D Beyond yet. But if I open up my binder I

2221
02:45:54,085 --> 02:46:04,433
bet I have a paper version that I can verify with.
I speak Sylvan, Common, and Celestial and I also

2222
02:46:04,433 --> 02:46:09,815
can Comprehend Languages as a ritual spell but I
think that takes some time.

2223
02:46:09,815 --> 02:46:10,881
MATT: It does take ten minutes.

2224
02:46:10,881 --> 02:46:12,693
LIAM: Ten minutes.

2225
02:46:12,693 --> 02:46:16,144
MATT: But you glance through the book, and while
you cannot read the text you do recognize that

2226
02:46:16,144 --> 02:46:26,632
there are elements at the back of the book that
have a hint of arcane nature. That's one of two

2227
02:46:26,632 --> 02:46:28,878
books you find with that roll.

2228
02:46:28,878 --> 02:46:30,822
SAM: It's like the adult section for him.

2229
02:46:30,822 --> 02:46:36,773
MATT: I know. The second book you find is written
in Zemnian, which you can read.

2230
02:46:36,773 --> 02:46:38,109
LIAM: That's correct.

2231
02:46:38,109 --> 02:46:44,238
MATT: The title translates to Fiends of Folklore.

2232
02:46:44,238 --> 02:46:52,990
LIAM: I'm so happy. You have quite a shop here.

2233
02:46:52,990 --> 02:46:55,200
MATT: "I know I do!"

2234
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:59,658
LIAM: You have some real treasures. I'm
particularly interested in both of these books.

2235
02:46:59,658 --> 02:47:05,615
MATT: "Good choices, good choices."

2236
02:47:05,615 --> 02:47:12,208
LIAM: I don't know though, I don't think that-- I
mean I'm rather tight on coin at the moment so--

2237
02:47:12,208 --> 02:47:13,846
MATT: "That's too bad."

2238
02:47:13,846 --> 02:47:16,470
LIAM: Maybe my eyes are too big for my stomach.

2239
02:47:16,470 --> 02:47:18,015
MATT: He's pulling the books away from you.

2240
02:47:18,015 --> 02:47:21,843
LIAM: How much would you part with these for?

2241
02:47:21,843 --> 02:47:38,547
MATT: (sniffs) He holds of the Fiends of Folklore
book, "Three gold pieces. This one, (sniffs)--

2242
02:47:38,547 --> 02:47:42,710
"ten gold pieces."

2243
02:47:42,710 --> 02:47:44,141
LIAM: Which one is which?

2244
02:47:44,141 --> 02:47:46,824
MATT: The Fiends of Folklore is the three, the
other tome.

2245
02:47:46,824 --> 02:47:49,186
LIAM: The arcane, weird one.

2246
02:47:49,186 --> 02:47:51,104
MATT: You're not quite sure what's in it.

2247
02:47:51,104 --> 02:48:01,653
LIAM: Okay. Would you have any interest in a magic
cat?

2248
02:48:01,653 --> 02:48:04,371
MATT: "I'm sorry?"

2249
02:48:04,371 --> 02:48:13,058
LIAM: Frumpkin disappears from on Nott's shoulder.
Reappears next to the little man.

2250
02:48:13,058 --> 02:48:20,050
MATT: (yelps) He like throws the books and grabs
nearby this large sack and starts--

2251
02:48:20,050 --> 02:48:23,496
angrily beating the cat.

2252
02:48:23,496 --> 02:48:25,251
LIAM: I'll take that as a no!

2253
02:48:25,251 --> 02:48:28,251
TRAVIS: Childhood cat, destroyed!

2254
02:48:28,251 --> 02:48:35,593
MATT: He does hit Frumpkin. Frumpkin takes one
point of bludgeoning damage.

2255
02:48:35,593 --> 02:48:44,594
LIAM: That might be it, I don't really know. I
didn't think that this would happen so quickly.

2256
02:48:44,594 --> 02:48:49,615
TRAVIS: Faced with our own mortality.

2257
02:48:49,615 --> 02:48:55,680
LAURA: Frumpkin point two.

2258
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:59,922
MARISHA: Yeah, he updates overnight as long as
he's plugged in, right?

2259
02:48:59,922 --> 02:49:02,998
LIAM: Hold on, I have to see if Frumpkin is still
here.

2260
02:49:02,998 --> 02:49:05,047
TRAVIS: Must be plugged in and connected to Wifi.

2261
02:49:05,047 --> 02:49:07,194
MARISHA: Type in your passcode if you agree to the
terms.

2262
02:49:07,194 --> 02:49:08,386
LIAM: One hit point of damage?

2263
02:49:08,386 --> 02:49:09,322
MATT: Yes.

2264
02:49:09,322 --> 02:49:10,772
LIAM: He's still here.

2265
02:49:10,772 --> 02:49:12,531
MATT: There you go. Frumpkin immediately darts off
jumps on your shoulder, turns around and

2266
02:49:12,531 --> 02:49:15,005
(hisses).

2267
02:49:15,005 --> 02:49:19,069
LIAM: So you don't like cats, I understand that.

2268
02:49:19,069 --> 02:49:23,099
MATT: "Sorry, it caught me off-guard."

2269
02:49:23,099 --> 02:49:27,611
LIAM: Well I was trying to sample the merchandise
for you. Because if it was just a cat it was just

2270
02:49:27,611 --> 02:49:33,420
a cat, but this one-- changes to my other
shoulder-- he's a magic cat.

2271
02:49:33,420 --> 02:49:35,852
MATT: "Okay."

2272
02:49:35,852 --> 02:49:39,286
LIAM: You can roll him in mud, he comes back
clean. He disappears, he reappears, he brings you

2273
02:49:39,286 --> 02:49:40,832
things.

2274
02:49:40,832 --> 02:49:43,439
MATT: "Can you make him go away?"

2275
02:49:43,439 --> 02:49:45,128
LIAM: Gone.

2276
02:49:45,128 --> 02:49:51,831
MATT: "Thank you. Now we can continue to talk
money."

2277
02:49:51,831 --> 02:50:03,324
LIAM: Here's what I propose. I do not have ten
gold at the moment. But it doesn't feel like you

2278
02:50:03,324 --> 02:50:12,395
get a lot of thoroughfare here, so I'm going to
come back to purchase this later. That's it.

2279
02:50:12,395 --> 02:50:16,411
That's the end of my spiel; that's all I've got.
I'm interested, and thank you for giving me the

2280
02:50:16,411 --> 02:50:17,495
time.

2281
02:50:17,495 --> 02:50:19,864
MATT: "Of course. Sorry about your cat, friend."

2282
02:50:19,864 --> 02:50:23,534
LIAM: It's okay. Nott?

2283
02:50:23,534 --> 02:50:25,209
SAM: Have I heard all of this conversation?

2284
02:50:25,209 --> 02:50:31,379
MATT: You've been hearing all of it, but you've
also found, amongst the chaos, a brass baby bottle

2285
02:50:31,379 --> 02:50:38,766
that's fairly dented, but it's very shiny and
polished, you can already see on the inside. You

2286
02:50:38,766 --> 02:50:48,404
find a new flask, actually. It's very tarnished,
but you spit and rub it a little bit. It looks to

2287
02:50:48,404 --> 02:50:52,304
be of very fine metallic material. You're not
entirely sure, you'd have to clean it, but it

2288
02:50:52,304 --> 02:50:55,727
looks like very nice quality material.

2289
02:50:55,727 --> 02:51:01,113
SAM: All right. I'll try to trade my flask with
that flask.

2290
02:51:01,113 --> 02:51:03,266
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

2291
02:51:03,266 --> 02:51:06,266
TRAVIS: Indiana Jones style.

2292
02:51:06,266 --> 02:51:08,279
SAM: 22!

2293
02:51:08,279 --> 02:51:09,824
TALIESIN: How?!

2294
02:51:09,824 --> 02:51:13,122
SAM: Wait. More. No, that's right. 22.

2295
02:51:13,122 --> 02:51:17,125
MATT: Now, your flask, which still has liquor in
it, is left behind for the empty flask you

2296
02:51:17,125 --> 02:51:22,801
receive. However, without an instance of anyone
even paying attention. It is yours. You can write

2297
02:51:22,801 --> 02:51:26,500
in your inventory you are now the owner of a
platinum flask.

2298
02:51:26,500 --> 02:51:29,046
ALL: Ooh!

2299
02:51:29,046 --> 02:51:36,318
SAM: Shit! Okay! It's a baby bottle, or maybe a
rattle? What'd you say?

2300
02:51:36,318 --> 02:51:43,325
MATT: Baby bottle. Looks like it was used as a
bottle for a very upper-class family.

2301
02:51:43,325 --> 02:51:45,731
TALIESIN: You're already so ahead, though!

2302
02:51:45,731 --> 02:51:53,620
SAM: I know. But I can't resist. I'll try to take
one more look and pocket that as well.

2303
02:51:53,620 --> 02:51:55,501
MATT: Make another sleight of hand check, please.

2304
02:51:55,501 --> 02:51:57,286
SAM: 20.

2305
02:51:57,286 --> 02:52:03,311
MATT: It just vanishes into your cloak! It's the
craziest thing! It was there and it's gone!

2306
02:52:03,311 --> 02:52:06,308
TRAVIS: Yes!

2307
02:52:06,308 --> 02:52:12,503
SAM: Are we going to leave now? Should we leave? I
think we should leave. Maybe we should go. Do you

2308
02:52:12,503 --> 02:52:15,218
need some money? I could lend you some money, if
you want.

2309
02:52:15,218 --> 02:52:17,306
LIAM: Maybe we'll come back tomorrow.

2310
02:52:17,306 --> 02:52:22,102
SAM: All right. Lovely place you got here!

2311
02:52:22,102 --> 02:52:23,388
LIAM: Piggyback?

2312
02:52:23,388 --> 02:52:25,459
SAM: Yes, please!

2313
02:52:25,459 --> 02:52:27,799
MATT: "I'll hold these books for you! Come back
when you can!"

2314
02:52:27,799 --> 02:52:30,384
LIAM: Within the week, I promise.

2315
02:52:30,384 --> 02:52:33,334
MATT: "All right. Have a good day, little girl!"

2316
02:52:33,334 --> 02:52:36,174
SAM: I will!

2317
02:52:36,174 --> 02:52:38,500
MATT: You guys exit the building.

2318
02:52:38,500 --> 02:52:45,603
SAM: I'm sorry! I did it again, I couldn't help
it. I took some things. Do you think he noticed?

2319
02:52:45,603 --> 02:52:49,042
Do you think we're in trouble? Maybe we should
hurry back.

2320
02:52:49,042 --> 02:52:51,768
LIAM: I don't think he saw.

2321
02:52:51,768 --> 02:52:54,994
SAM: All right. Are you cross with me?

2322
02:52:54,994 --> 02:53:00,316
LIAM: No. Just wait one moment, okay? Wait for me
here?

2323
02:53:00,316 --> 02:53:06,971
SAM: Okay. I heard you talking about money, by the
way, I could lend you some, if you'd like.

2324
02:53:06,971 --> 02:53:14,254
LIAM: Wait right here. I cast Detect Magic just
before I walk back into the store. I look all

2325
02:53:14,254 --> 02:53:22,503
around. What are your hours, here? As I look to
see if there is anything besides that book,

2326
02:53:22,503 --> 02:53:24,360
anything.

2327
02:53:24,360 --> 02:53:29,389
MATT: You glance throughout the interior, and you
don't sense anything magical, unfortunately,

2328
02:53:29,389 --> 02:53:31,538
within the piles of rubble.

2329
02:53:31,538 --> 02:53:33,316
LIAM: Besides the book he put down?

2330
02:53:33,316 --> 02:53:39,926
MATT: The book's not radiating any magical aura.
But he answers. "Oh! All hours! I don't really

2331
02:53:39,926 --> 02:53:42,248
"close. I don't really sleep."

2332
02:53:42,248 --> 02:53:43,551
LIAM: Middle of the night, even?

2333
02:53:43,551 --> 02:53:44,666
MATT: "Sure!"

2334
02:53:44,666 --> 02:53:46,947
LIAM: All right. Business is business. Thank you!

2335
02:53:46,947 --> 02:53:49,004
MATT: "No worries. See you then!"

2336
02:53:49,004 --> 02:53:50,725
LIAM: Bis später.

2337
02:53:50,725 --> 02:53:54,925
MATT: "Pee shmiter!"

2338
02:53:54,925 --> 02:53:56,670
LIAM: That guy does not speak Zemnian!

2339
02:53:56,670 --> 02:54:01,915
MATT: No, he does not.

2340
02:54:01,915 --> 02:54:04,310
LIAM: Let's go back to the hotel, shall we?

2341
02:54:04,310 --> 02:54:06,429
SAM: Let's do it.

2342
02:54:06,429 --> 02:54:12,721
MATT: While they're away, you guys wait there for
a bit, getting stir crazy in the process of

2343
02:54:12,721 --> 02:54:20,165
waiting in your room. Jester and Beauregard,
there's a knock at your door.

2344
02:54:20,165 --> 02:54:22,602
LAURA: Hello?

2345
02:54:22,602 --> 02:54:25,555
MATT: "Please open, it's Crownsguard."

2346
02:54:25,555 --> 02:54:28,038
LAURA: Hold on, I'm naked!

2347
02:54:28,038 --> 02:54:33,558
(whispering) Yeah, I don't know. Do you 
want to put clothes on?

2348
02:54:33,558 --> 02:54:36,838
Should we take our clothes off?

2349
02:54:36,838 --> 02:54:40,254
MARISHA: Did you say that because you wanted to
tell me something?

2350
02:54:40,254 --> 02:54:46,120
LAURA: No, I just wanted to make them wait. Okay,
I'm dressed now!

2351
02:54:46,120 --> 02:54:50,631
MARISHA: I like that. We're giving them--
authority. Got the upper hand. Okay.

2352
02:54:50,631 --> 02:54:52,400
LAURA: It's a power play.

2353
02:54:52,400 --> 02:54:56,041
MARISHA: Do we invite them in or are we going
to--? You open the door. I'm going to sit,

2354
02:54:56,041 --> 02:54:57,944
unassuming, on the bed.

2355
02:54:57,944 --> 02:55:00,834
LAURA: Sit! Come in, please.

2356
02:55:00,834 --> 02:55:04,161
MARISHA: Oh!

2357
02:55:04,161 --> 02:55:08,270
MATT: The door opens, and there are two
crownsguards there, standing, shields to the

2358
02:55:08,270 --> 02:55:09,359
side.

2359
02:55:09,359 --> 02:55:12,218
LAURA: Oh hello, I wasn't expecting you.

2360
02:55:12,218 --> 02:55:15,942
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, hi.

2361
02:55:15,942 --> 02:55:20,612
MATT: "We're here to notify you that the
investigation is ongoing. You will not be needed

2362
02:55:20,612 --> 02:55:25,198
"today. Please remain in your premises. Be back
tomorrow."

2363
02:55:25,198 --> 02:55:26,622
TRAVIS: Jury summon.

2364
02:55:26,622 --> 02:55:32,890
MARISHA: Bullshit! Jury duty shit! Goddamn it!

2365
02:55:32,890 --> 02:55:34,541
TALIESIN: We are at D&D Jury Duty.

2366
02:55:34,541 --> 02:55:37,712
MATT: Yes you are.

2367
02:55:37,712 --> 02:55:41,601
MARISHA: Seven dollars a day? What is this shit?

2368
02:55:41,601 --> 02:55:43,654
LAURA: Can I ask you a question before you leave?

2369
02:55:43,654 --> 02:55:45,260
MATT: "Yes, what is your question?"

2370
02:55:45,260 --> 02:55:48,967
LAURA: Are you guys going to be the same people
coming back tomorrow?

2371
02:55:48,967 --> 02:55:49,997
MATT: "Possibly."

2372
02:55:49,997 --> 02:55:52,221
LAURA: What is your names?

2373
02:55:52,221 --> 02:55:56,870
MATT: They look at each other, look back at you.
"I am Jonas." The other guy pipes up, he's a

2374
02:55:56,870 --> 02:55:59,438
little younger, he goes, "I am Lucas."

2375
02:55:59,438 --> 02:56:02,436
LAURA: Jonas and Lucas, very good names.

2376
02:56:02,436 --> 02:56:06,781
MARISHA: You guys should start a band. Like a boy
band or something.

2377
02:56:06,781 --> 02:56:15,612
LAURA: Yeah, that'd be good. Girls would go crazy.
If you guys want to play some games tomorrow,

2378
02:56:15,612 --> 02:56:18,200
we'll just be here!

2379
02:56:18,200 --> 02:56:25,225
MATT: "Very well! Have a good day." They look at
each other like, "What?" and close the door.

2380
02:56:25,225 --> 02:56:28,471
LAURA: I shouldn't have offered the game. What if
we want to leave and then they want to take us up

2381
02:56:28,471 --> 02:56:30,095
on the game thing?

2382
02:56:30,095 --> 02:56:31,574
MARISHA: I thought you enjoyed games.

2383
02:56:31,574 --> 02:56:33,106
LAURA: No, I love games!

2384
02:56:33,106 --> 02:56:34,064
MARISHA: Sure.

2385
02:56:34,064 --> 02:56:37,692
LAURA: But what if we leave and then they want to
&lt;i>play&lt;/i> games?

2386
02:56:37,692 --> 02:56:40,322
MARISHA: Okay.

2387
02:56:40,322 --> 02:56:43,981
MATT: Onto Fjord's door.

2388
02:56:43,981 --> 02:56:45,968
TALIESIN: I'm sitting playing with the cards.

2389
02:56:45,968 --> 02:56:47,539
TRAVIS: I open it.

2390
02:56:47,539 --> 02:56:58,325
MATT: Same two guards there. Lucas and Jonas.
Jonas and Lucas. "Hello. The investigation is

2391
02:56:58,325 --> 02:57:02,293
"ongoing. You'll not be needed for today. We will
return tomorrow."

2392
02:57:02,293 --> 02:57:03,987
TRAVIS: I shut the door.

2393
02:57:03,987 --> 02:57:05,416
TALIESIN: Any progress?

2394
02:57:05,416 --> 02:57:13,286
MATT: There's a pause and then you here the subtle
shifting of greaves against the wooden floor as

2395
02:57:13,286 --> 02:57:15,692
they slowly walk away.

2396
02:57:15,692 --> 02:57:18,868
TRAVIS: Go take that game in the other room, why
don't you?

2397
02:57:18,868 --> 02:57:20,710
TALIESIN: That was a power move right there.

2398
02:57:20,710 --> 02:57:22,766
TRAVIS: Thank you.

2399
02:57:22,766 --> 02:57:27,176
MATT: You guys return to the inn.

2400
02:57:27,176 --> 02:57:28,998
SAM: I guess we do.

2401
02:57:28,998 --> 02:57:31,130
MATT: Yes you do.

2402
02:57:31,130 --> 02:57:36,552
SAM: Well. That was terrible. No one found out
anything. It was a waste of a day. We're all

2403
02:57:36,552 --> 02:57:40,567
terrible at this. Goodnight?

2404
02:57:40,567 --> 02:57:42,890
LAURA: What time is it?

2405
02:57:42,890 --> 02:57:48,884
MARISHA: That's not true! I still say that some of
the best information that you can get can be in

2406
02:57:48,884 --> 02:57:51,463
the information that you don't find.

2407
02:57:51,463 --> 02:57:53,570
SAM: That is nonsense.

2408
02:57:53,570 --> 02:58:01,897
MARISHA: I'm just saying! Sometimes the lack of
information can be a process of elimination.

2409
02:58:01,897 --> 02:58:03,593
TRAVIS: Sure.

2410
02:58:03,593 --> 02:58:05,677
MARISHA: It's super broad!

2411
02:58:05,677 --> 02:58:08,722
TALIESIN: No, you know what? I'm going to take
it.

2412
02:58:08,722 --> 02:58:16,296
MARISHA: I'm trying to be fucking silver lining,
so I don't feel like a piece of shit for waste a

2413
02:58:16,296 --> 02:58:19,093
day, and you guys are shitting on that, but it's
fine.

2414
02:58:19,093 --> 02:58:21,234
TRAVIS: You found nothing at the docks, zip,
zero?

2415
02:58:21,234 --> 02:58:25,105
LIAM: We spent hours there, no one knew anything
about the old man.

2416
02:58:25,105 --> 02:58:34,316
MARISHA: See? No one knew anything about him. That
means, prime candidate, someone's little

2417
02:58:34,316 --> 02:58:39,137
experiment. Little Frankenstein. I'm telling you.

2418
02:58:39,137 --> 02:58:41,108
LIAM: I don't really understand what she's
saying.

2419
02:58:41,108 --> 02:58:46,254
LAURA: I don't either. I'm going to run up and
down the stairs for a while.

2420
02:58:46,254 --> 02:58:49,120
MATT: (quick footsteps)

2421
02:58:49,120 --> 02:58:51,819
TALIESIN: How long have you known this one?

2422
02:58:51,819 --> 02:58:53,407
MARISHA: Who are you talking to?

2423
02:58:53,407 --> 02:58:55,619
TALIESIN: Anybody who's watching this happen.

2424
02:58:55,619 --> 02:59:00,338
MARISHA: About 24 hours longer than you have.

2425
02:59:00,338 --> 02:59:01,872
TALIESIN: That explains a lot.

2426
02:59:01,872 --> 02:59:08,920
MATT: At one point, Adelaine the barmaid comes up.
"I'm sorry, can you &lt;i>please&lt;/i> stop?"

2427
02:59:08,920 --> 02:59:10,058
LAURA: Okay.

2428
02:59:10,058 --> 02:59:12,894
MATT: "Thank you!"

2429
02:59:12,894 --> 02:59:14,340
SAM: Hey, Dungeon Master?

2430
02:59:14,340 --> 02:59:15,626
MATT: Yes?

2431
02:59:15,626 --> 02:59:23,718
SAM: The other night, when Nott was out carousing
a bit while Caleb was asleep. He saw some figures

2432
02:59:23,718 --> 02:59:30,676
in cloaks dash by. Was there any distinctive
anything about these three figures that

2433
02:59:30,676 --> 02:59:31,763
dashed by?

2434
02:59:31,763 --> 02:59:33,810
MATT: Not that you noticed, unfortunately.

2435
02:59:33,810 --> 02:59:41,895
SAM: Damn it. Okay, I will share that information
with the group. I saw some weirdos running

2436
02:59:41,895 --> 02:59:43,458
around.

2437
02:59:43,458 --> 02:59:45,682
LAURA: When?

2438
02:59:45,682 --> 02:59:47,659
SAM: The other night, when he was asleep.

2439
02:59:47,659 --> 02:59:49,320
TRAVIS: How late?

2440
02:59:49,320 --> 02:59:51,130
SAM: Two in the morning?

2441
02:59:51,130 --> 02:59:53,490
LIAM: You were out that late?

2442
02:59:53,490 --> 02:59:54,921
SAM: Sorry.

2443
02:59:54,921 --> 02:59:57,717
LAURA: Maybe we should go out at two o'clock in
the morning and see if we can find them.

2444
02:59:57,717 --> 02:59:59,036
MARISHA: Ooh, that's a good idea.

2445
02:59:59,036 --> 03:00:00,350
LAURA: Follow them.

2446
03:00:00,350 --> 03:00:04,909
MARISHA: You guys notice that it's weird that no
one's actually really talking about this? This is

2447
03:00:04,909 --> 03:00:09,983
a small town. I come from a small town. Small town
people gossip.

2448
03:00:09,983 --> 03:00:14,976
TALIESIN: I feel like there should be some more
gossip then there is, that's very true.

2449
03:00:14,976 --> 03:00:20,560
MARISHA: Someone is talking about this, we just
haven't found them yet. 2:00AM field trip!

2450
03:00:20,560 --> 03:00:22,996
LAURA: We can always leave through the window this
time.

2451
03:00:22,996 --> 03:00:25,530
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, I like that.

2452
03:00:25,530 --> 03:00:27,688
TRAVIS: I can be down for that.

2453
03:00:27,688 --> 03:00:34,927
TALIESIN: I leave the rope tied in here. Can we
use your cat? Reel it back up in so that there's

2454
03:00:34,927 --> 03:00:38,488
no trace of us until we need to get back there.

2455
03:00:38,488 --> 03:00:41,460
LIAM: Are you asking for my cat to haul up our
rope?

2456
03:00:41,460 --> 03:00:44,213
TALIESIN: No, I'm telling you that your cat is
going to haul up a rope.

2457
03:00:44,213 --> 03:00:46,317
LAURA: How is a cat going to lift up a rope?

2458
03:00:46,317 --> 03:00:49,440
TALIESIN: It's not that heavy of a rope, it's just
hemp.

2459
03:00:49,440 --> 03:00:52,791
MATT: Hemp rope can be pretty heavy.

2460
03:00:52,791 --> 03:00:56,263
TALIESIN: Well, if I throw it back up there then I
imagine you cat can knock it back down at the very

2461
03:00:56,263 --> 03:00:57,299
least.

2462
03:00:57,299 --> 03:00:59,423
LAURA: There, that would work, maybe.

2463
03:00:59,423 --> 03:01:01,828
MARISHA: Oh, is he like an asshole cat?

2464
03:01:01,828 --> 03:01:05,021
TALIESIN: I assume he's an asshole cat. Aren't all
cats asshole cats?

2465
03:01:05,021 --> 03:01:06,829
MATT: This is true.

2466
03:01:06,829 --> 03:01:10,871
LAURA: It might be down before we come back, is
the thing.

2467
03:01:10,871 --> 03:01:13,737
TALIESIN: I assume he's going to-- that's fair.

2468
03:01:13,737 --> 03:01:19,322
TRAVIS: Where were you when you saw these cloaked
figures?

2469
03:01:19,322 --> 03:01:23,566
SAM: I had gone out to do some window shopping.

2470
03:01:23,566 --> 03:01:25,828
TRAVIS: At 2:00AM?

2471
03:01:25,828 --> 03:01:31,674
SAM: Yes, I wasn't very successful. I had walked
by the general store--

2472
03:01:31,674 --> 03:01:33,289
LAURA: Oh, we went there.

2473
03:01:33,289 --> 03:01:34,523
MARISHA: Yeah, we did.

2474
03:01:34,523 --> 03:01:41,611
SAM: I passed by a place called Natural Remedies,
herbs and medicinal things. I went by a spot named

2475
03:01:41,611 --> 03:01:45,343
Jackalwere, it's a smithy.

2476
03:01:45,343 --> 03:01:47,611
LAURA: Okay, but where did you see the cloaked
guys?

2477
03:01:47,611 --> 03:01:50,306
SAM: It was between-- I don't remember.

2478
03:01:50,306 --> 03:01:54,936
MATT: It was one block north of the Natural
Remedies.

2479
03:01:54,936 --> 03:01:58,663
MARISHA: Natural Remedies. What was the other one?
Jackalwere?

2480
03:01:58,663 --> 03:02:00,278
SAM: I think that was what it was called.

2481
03:02:00,278 --> 03:02:06,201
MATT: Yeah, Jackalwere Smiths.

2482
03:02:06,201 --> 03:02:08,450
SAM: We could do a little stakeout!

2483
03:02:08,450 --> 03:02:10,541
TRAVIS: We could.

2484
03:02:10,541 --> 03:02:17,654
MARISHA: That's true. How do people send messages
in this town? Have we figured that out?

2485
03:02:17,654 --> 03:02:22,215
SAM: Probably by foot or by horse, right?

2486
03:02:22,215 --> 03:02:23,963
TALIESIN: Not that big of a town.

2487
03:02:23,963 --> 03:02:26,742
TRAVIS: Should someone stay up? Well, I was
thinking someone should keep a lookout on the roof

2488
03:02:26,742 --> 03:02:29,793
of the inn in case someone comes for us while
everyone else is out.

2489
03:02:29,793 --> 03:02:32,470
LAURA: How would we let anybody know?

2490
03:02:32,470 --> 03:02:39,235
TRAVIS: I don't know. Can you conjure those golden
orbs up into the air as like a signal?

2491
03:02:39,235 --> 03:02:43,780
LIAM: It's pretty limited. They don't go that
far.

2492
03:02:43,780 --> 03:02:46,255
TRAVIS: Maybe we just risk it.

2493
03:02:46,255 --> 03:02:47,235
SAM: Yeah!

2494
03:02:47,235 --> 03:02:49,599
LAURA: Let's risk it.

2495
03:02:49,599 --> 03:02:57,941
TRAVIS: It's 2:00AM, I'm sure everybody will be
asleep. Let's risk it.

2496
03:02:57,941 --> 03:03:08,509
MARISHA: Before we leave--

2497
03:03:08,509 --> 03:03:12,725
is there a window in
the hall? Or are there only windows in our bedrooms?

2498
03:03:12,725 --> 03:03:15,457
MATT: There is no window in the hall, only in the
rooms.

2499
03:03:15,457 --> 03:03:19,155
MARISHA: Okay, that's fine. On our side of the
room--

2500
03:03:19,155 --> 03:03:23,236
MATT: You have three rooms between you.

2501
03:03:23,236 --> 03:03:24,709
TALIESIN: There's three rooms and they all have
windows.

2502
03:03:24,709 --> 03:03:26,227
MATT: Correct.

2503
03:03:26,227 --> 03:03:38,920
MARISHA: On our side of the door, I'm going to
take out my healer's kit. Do I have any bandages

2504
03:03:38,920 --> 03:03:43,483
or medical tape or anything like that?

2505
03:03:43,483 --> 03:03:50,690
MATT: Not medical tape, but there are clean strips
of cloth and some adhesive bandages, basic

2506
03:03:50,690 --> 03:03:51,730
general--

2507
03:03:51,730 --> 03:03:54,643
LAURA: No tape?!

2508
03:03:54,643 --> 03:04:03,606
MARISHA: I'm going to tie a bandage ever so
lightly around one side of the handle onto

2509
03:04:03,606 --> 03:04:10,727
something on to the other side of the door. If
there's something like a lamp or some kind of pipe

2510
03:04:10,727 --> 03:04:12,920
or something I can tie it to.

2511
03:04:12,920 --> 03:04:14,541
LAURA: So that we'll know if someone tried to come
in the room?

2512
03:04:14,541 --> 03:04:15,538
MARISHA: Correct.

2513
03:04:15,538 --> 03:04:17,090
LAURA: Okay.

2514
03:04:17,090 --> 03:04:24,895
MATT: You can pull one bandage out and affix to
one of the chair legs nearby. You could do that.

2515
03:04:24,895 --> 03:04:29,477
TALIESIN: Oh for god's sake. I pull out a big
thing of string.

2516
03:04:29,477 --> 03:04:34,711
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. I'll take some string and
just some twine and--

2517
03:04:34,711 --> 03:04:37,998
LAURA: What are we going to do? Leave through our
window?

2518
03:04:37,998 --> 03:04:39,152
MARISHA: Yeah.

2519
03:04:39,152 --> 03:04:41,748
LAURA: To their window?

2520
03:04:41,748 --> 03:04:44,849
MARISHA: Well, I figured we're all in the same
room at this point.

2521
03:04:44,849 --> 03:04:47,255
LIAM: What are you trying to do?

2522
03:04:47,255 --> 03:04:52,367
MARISHA: I'm trying to make sure that if someone
tries to come in our room we'll know if they come in.

2523
03:04:52,367 --> 03:04:53,889
LIAM: I can take care of that.

2524
03:04:53,889 --> 03:04:55,906
TALIESIN: Oh, well then, I'm taking my string
back.

2525
03:04:55,906 --> 03:04:57,663
MARISHA: What can you do?

2526
03:04:57,663 --> 03:05:02,513
LIAM: I have some magic for that.

2527
03:05:02,513 --> 03:05:08,175
SAM: Yeah, he has a magical spell that alerts you
when someone tries to break in your room.

2528
03:05:08,175 --> 03:05:15,856
LIAM: That is correct. Yeah. I will take a moment
to do that and it will let me know.

2529
03:05:15,856 --> 03:05:19,963
SAM: Best part is, it doesn't alert him when I
sneak in or out.

2530
03:05:19,963 --> 03:05:21,486
LIAM: That you know of.

2531
03:05:21,486 --> 03:05:28,424
SAM: Wait. What?

2532
03:05:28,424 --> 03:05:30,415
LIAM: One mile of the warded area.

2533
03:05:30,415 --> 03:05:31,685
SAM: Ooh!

2534
03:05:31,685 --> 03:05:33,531
MARISHA: That's better! Let's do that.

2535
03:05:33,531 --> 03:05:37,659
LIAM: I just need ten minutes. And I pull out a
little spool of silvered thread and stretch it

2536
03:05:37,659 --> 03:05:42,459
out. Where did you want this? Over the window?

2537
03:05:42,459 --> 03:05:48,436
MARISHA: Well, I was going to say in the door, but
if there's maybe a place in the hall.

2538
03:05:48,436 --> 03:05:54,240
LIAM: Well, I can do the entire room really, I can
go doorknob to-- The funny thing about this

2539
03:05:54,240 --> 03:05:59,870
thread, there's no end to it. So I start looping
it all the way around the room and tie it off, and

2540
03:05:59,870 --> 03:06:05,962
take out one of my books from the holster, the one
on the left side, and I open it up. You guys watch

2541
03:06:05,962 --> 03:06:11,828
as I spend ten minutes referring to the book and
tracing symbols on the floor. Along, underneath

2542
03:06:11,828 --> 03:06:20,682
the thread, and about ten minutes of time, nothing
happens, but that's taken care of.

2543
03:06:20,682 --> 03:06:22,129
LAURA: Nice.

2544
03:06:22,129 --> 03:06:23,760
SAM: See, he's really good.

2545
03:06:23,760 --> 03:06:25,120
LAURA: Yeah.

2546
03:06:25,120 --> 03:06:27,522
TRAVIS: Didn't really look like much.

2547
03:06:27,522 --> 03:06:30,569
LIAM: Yeah, either that or I'm really bullshitting
you and nothing happened.

2548
03:06:30,569 --> 03:06:35,036
LAURA: Either way, I liked it. Let's sneak out.

2549
03:06:35,036 --> 03:06:38,219
TALIESIN: I'm going to do one last thing before we
leave, which is just tussle the room a bit so it

2550
03:06:38,219 --> 03:06:41,791
looks like it's been robbed. Just in case they do
come in.

2551
03:06:41,791 --> 03:06:46,264
MATT: Okay, so you toss the room a bit, muddle up
the space, and you guys, one by one, climb out the

2552
03:06:46,264 --> 03:06:54,000
back of the window, down the rope, and into the
alley behind the inn. Looking about, you're

2553
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:55,771
waiting until about post-midnight, you said?

2554
03:06:55,771 --> 03:06:56,832
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2555
03:06:56,832 --> 03:07:02,622
MATT: Okay, so it's dark. The various lanterns
that dangle on the hook poles at different

2556
03:07:02,622 --> 03:07:07,324
intersections of the street are lit. Other than
that, you have a faint bit of moonlight that's

2557
03:07:07,324 --> 03:07:11,046
coming through the sky. There are some clouds, but
they're a bit broken up, so every now and then the

2558
03:07:11,046 --> 03:07:16,344
moon cover can vanish and then return, but for now
you have moonlight in the city. Where are you guys

2559
03:07:16,344 --> 03:07:18,501
going?

2560
03:07:18,501 --> 03:07:20,814
LAURA: Towards the north end.

2561
03:07:20,814 --> 03:07:22,781
TRAVIS: I ought to be leading the way, I reckon.

2562
03:07:22,781 --> 03:07:27,805
SAM: Yeah, I'll go to where I saw the three
cloaked figures.

2563
03:07:27,805 --> 03:07:30,140
MATT: A little ways north of Natural Remedies?
Okay. I would like everybody to make a stealth

2564
03:07:30,140 --> 03:07:32,193
check, please.

2565
03:07:32,193 --> 03:07:34,800
SAM: Stealth check. Do I still have the blessing?
No, I don't.

2566
03:07:34,800 --> 03:07:40,814
LAURA: No, you don't. But I can do it to
everybody, one by one, if we get to an open area.

2567
03:07:40,814 --> 03:07:42,362
SAM: 21.

2568
03:07:42,362 --> 03:07:43,726
TRAVIS: 15.

2569
03:07:43,726 --> 03:07:44,709
MARISHA: 19.

2570
03:07:44,709 --> 03:07:46,450
TALIESIN: 17.

2571
03:07:46,450 --> 03:07:48,783
LAURA: 21.

2572
03:07:48,783 --> 03:07:52,039
LIAM: Forty-- 12.

2573
03:07:52,039 --> 03:07:53,738
SAM: 42.

2574
03:07:53,738 --> 03:07:57,634
MATT: You guys, following Nott, dodge between
alleys, there are a few patrols of the crownsguard

2575
03:07:57,634 --> 03:08:03,683
that you see passing by, and you wait for them to
just cross paths, and then move on. Eventually

2576
03:08:03,683 --> 03:08:08,218
finding your way to Natural Remedies, seemingly
unseen. It's quiet, you can hear the sound of

2577
03:08:08,218 --> 03:08:13,444
crickets in the distance. The cold night air is
causing your breath to show every time you exhale,

2578
03:08:13,444 --> 03:08:19,206
you all bundle your cloaks as you move on. The
moonlight fades a bit, things get darker, but you

2579
03:08:19,206 --> 03:08:25,612
follow Nott's lead, travel from place to place.
You finally get to the outskirts of Natural

2580
03:08:25,612 --> 03:08:30,540
Remedies, and to the northern alleyway where you'd
originally seen those figures pass. You're there.

2581
03:08:30,540 --> 03:08:34,686
SAM: Should we fan out a bit? Cover a couple
corners, so we can still see each other?

2582
03:08:34,686 --> 03:08:35,950
TRAVIS: Good idea.

2583
03:08:35,950 --> 03:08:38,949
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to go with Fjord.

2584
03:08:38,949 --> 03:08:42,549
MARISHA: Let's not spread out too far, though.

2585
03:08:42,549 --> 03:08:45,001
SAM: Are you two like an item?

2586
03:08:45,001 --> 03:08:46,056
LAURA: What?

2587
03:08:46,056 --> 03:08:48,324
SAM: You and Fjord, are you like a thing?

2588
03:08:48,324 --> 03:08:49,997
LAURA: Why, are you interested in him?

2589
03:08:49,997 --> 03:08:51,626
SAM: No, ugh, no!

2590
03:08:51,626 --> 03:08:52,809
LAURA: No?

2591
03:08:52,809 --> 03:08:54,362
SAM: You travel together.

2592
03:08:54,362 --> 03:09:04,084
LAURA: Well yeah, he's a good friend. He watches
out for me, I watch out for him, you know. We're a

2593
03:09:04,084 --> 03:09:08,131
good team. Like you and Caleb.

2594
03:09:08,131 --> 03:09:13,584
SAM: Not at all like that, but yes, all right.

2595
03:09:13,584 --> 03:09:21,019
MATT: As you guys fan out a little bit, everyone
make a perception check.

2596
03:09:21,019 --> 03:09:24,611
LAURA: Natural one.

2597
03:09:24,611 --> 03:09:27,804
SAM: 19.

2598
03:09:27,804 --> 03:09:29,409
LAURA: I don't see shit.

2599
03:09:29,409 --> 03:09:30,386
MARISHA: Perception?

2600
03:09:30,386 --> 03:09:31,688
TALIESIN: 12.

2601
03:09:31,688 --> 03:09:32,842
TRAVIS: Nine.

2602
03:09:32,842 --> 03:09:34,200
MARISHA: 18.

2603
03:09:34,200 --> 03:09:35,466
LIAM: Ten.

2604
03:09:35,466 --> 03:09:38,915
MATT: Okay, so all of you, except for Jester,
manage to get a clear view of your vicinity.

2605
03:09:38,915 --> 03:09:44,191
Jester, you somehow get an eyelash caught in your
eye and spend the next hour trying to get it out,

2606
03:09:44,191 --> 03:09:46,586
but it's in the eyelid.

2607
03:09:46,586 --> 03:09:48,308
LAURA: Fjord, can you see it?

2608
03:09:48,308 --> 03:09:50,721
TRAVIS: Look up. Yeah.

2609
03:09:50,721 --> 03:09:52,694
MARISHA: To the left.

2610
03:09:52,694 --> 03:09:54,540
TRAVIS: Let me get it--

2611
03:09:54,540 --> 03:09:59,039
LAURA: No, no, no. Okay, okay, okay.

2612
03:09:59,039 --> 03:10:01,504
MATT: Occasionally, you can hear the crownsguard
approaching, and they carry their torches with

2613
03:10:01,504 --> 03:10:05,569
them. You can see the light crawling forward, so
you all duck out of the way and let them pass.

2614
03:10:05,569 --> 03:10:15,700
About an hour passes. Two hours pass. Around the
third hour, you get the sensation that whatever

2615
03:10:15,700 --> 03:10:21,638
you saw the other night is not arriving on a
clockwork time or not arriving at all. It's about

2616
03:10:21,638 --> 03:10:26,153
three in the morning, in the center of the city by
yourself. What do you wish to do?

2617
03:10:26,153 --> 03:10:27,197
MARISHA: Three in the morning?

2618
03:10:27,197 --> 03:10:29,338
MATT: Yeah.

2619
03:10:29,338 --> 03:10:35,225
MARISHA: I turn to Caleb. Any tingling from your
alarm system?

2620
03:10:35,225 --> 03:10:37,799
LIAM: No, I wouldn't have brought it up if
something had happened.

2621
03:10:37,799 --> 03:10:40,650
MARISHA: That's a good point.

2622
03:10:40,650 --> 03:10:50,175
TALIESIN: I'm just going to try to meditate on the
strange death and see if I can feel anything.

2623
03:10:50,175 --> 03:10:56,024
MATT: Okay.

2624
03:10:56,024 --> 03:10:57,808
Make an intelligence check.

2625
03:10:57,808 --> 03:11:00,302
TALIESIN: All right. Just see how this goes.

2626
03:11:00,302 --> 03:11:02,337
SAM: Mediation check.

2627
03:11:02,337 --> 03:11:04,727
TALIESIN: 17.

2628
03:11:04,727 --> 03:11:09,584
MATT: Pouring over the details of what has
transpired and what you guys have done so far to

2629
03:11:09,584 --> 03:11:18,019
find information, there are still things to
inquire about. There are still things to wonder

2630
03:11:18,019 --> 03:11:21,613
and discover and there are a few places you
haven't been to. A few places you haven't returned

2631
03:11:21,613 --> 03:11:29,174
to. A few people you haven't even inquired about
closer to the investigation.

2632
03:11:29,174 --> 03:11:31,308
LAURA: Oh, we should talk to the girl.

2633
03:11:31,308 --> 03:11:32,702
SAM: Toya?

2634
03:11:32,702 --> 03:11:33,995
LAURA: Yeah.

2635
03:11:33,995 --> 03:11:36,370
SAM: Let's go wake her ass up.

2636
03:11:36,370 --> 03:11:38,592
MARISHA: Is she under arrest? We don't know.

2637
03:11:38,592 --> 03:11:40,490
TALIESIN: Maybe we have to go back to the circus.

2638
03:11:40,490 --> 03:11:42,358
LAURA: Maybe it was Yasha.

2639
03:11:42,358 --> 03:11:43,957
TALIESIN: It's early enough maybe we should
just--

2640
03:11:43,957 --> 03:11:46,181
TRAVIS: We have a few more hours and the cover of
darkness.

2641
03:11:46,181 --> 03:11:48,529
SAM: Yeah, let's go wake her ass up.

2642
03:11:48,529 --> 03:11:53,840
MARISHA: Maybe we should go back to the circus.
Scene of the crime? That whole thing?

2643
03:11:53,840 --> 03:11:58,832
TALIESIN: I hate to admit it, but maybe-- it's not
us.

2644
03:11:58,832 --> 03:12:01,400
TRAVIS: Who's &lt;i>real&lt;/i> stealthy?

2645
03:12:01,400 --> 03:12:03,546
MARISHA: I'm all right.

2646
03:12:03,546 --> 03:12:08,359
TRAVIS: Maybe we don't &lt;i>all&lt;/i> need to go. Maybe
just a few, and the others will hang back.

2647
03:12:08,359 --> 03:12:12,522
SAM: Hang back close by though, right? If
something goes bad--

2648
03:12:12,522 --> 03:12:20,829
MARISHA: Or if you see something. How far are we
from the inn?

2649
03:12:20,829 --> 03:12:27,052
MATT: From the inn? About a 15 minute jog.

2650
03:12:27,052 --> 03:12:29,037
SAM: So we can go to the circus?

2651
03:12:29,037 --> 03:12:30,818
TRAVIS: An hour and a half.

2652
03:12:30,818 --> 03:12:33,676
LAURA: While we're still trying to figure this
out, I'm going to take out my painter's kit and

2653
03:12:33,676 --> 03:12:39,815
draw like a little piece of poop on the side of
the building that we're next to.

2654
03:12:39,815 --> 03:12:41,444
SAM: Tagging? That's good.

2655
03:12:41,444 --> 03:12:42,960
MARISHA: A little tagger.

2656
03:12:42,960 --> 03:12:44,619
TRAVIS: Is it like a mound of poop or like a
single--?

2657
03:12:44,619 --> 03:12:46,290
LAURA: No it's like a mound of poop.

2658
03:12:46,290 --> 03:12:47,590
TALIESIN: It's like an emoji.

2659
03:12:47,590 --> 03:12:52,692
MATT: Make a performance check.

2660
03:12:52,692 --> 03:12:56,034
LAURA: Oh I rolled really low on this one. Four!

2661
03:12:56,034 --> 03:13:02,984
MATT: It takes a little convincing to have them
see the poop in the drawing. You can see it, but

2662
03:13:02,984 --> 03:13:04,409
you've seen better.

2663
03:13:04,409 --> 03:13:06,110
TRAVIS: Is it a worm? It's a snake.

2664
03:13:06,110 --> 03:13:08,238
LAURA: It's poop, I should've--

2665
03:13:08,238 --> 03:13:10,386
LIAM: That's an &lt;i>oval&lt;/i>.

2666
03:13:10,386 --> 03:13:14,993
LAURA: I should have drawn a &lt;i>pile&lt;/i> of poop. I
draw a pile of poop next to it.

2667
03:13:14,993 --> 03:13:16,712
MATT: It helps, but--

2668
03:13:16,712 --> 03:13:18,481
LIAM: That's a triangle.

2669
03:13:18,481 --> 03:13:20,566
TRAVIS: Yeah, I thought it was like chocolate
frozen yogurt.

2670
03:13:20,566 --> 03:13:22,161
TALIESIN: Is math or something?

2671
03:13:22,161 --> 03:13:27,895
LAURA: It's dark okay?! I can usually paint much
better than this. It's really dark and my hands

2672
03:13:27,895 --> 03:13:31,093
feel a little numb.

2673
03:13:31,093 --> 03:13:32,959
SAM: Let's move then.

2674
03:13:32,959 --> 03:13:35,685
MATT: Who's going where? What are you guys doing?

2675
03:13:35,685 --> 03:13:37,421
ALL: We're all going to the circus.

2676
03:13:37,421 --> 03:13:38,948
TRAVIS: &lt;i>Stealthily&lt;/i> to the circus.

2677
03:13:38,948 --> 03:13:40,989
MATT: All right, I would like for all of you to
roll a stealth check.

2678
03:13:40,989 --> 03:13:42,548
MARISHA: Is no one staying behind or--?

2679
03:13:42,548 --> 03:13:43,602
LAURA: Fuck it!

2680
03:13:43,602 --> 03:13:45,031
SAM: Some are staying &lt;i>away&lt;/i> from the tent.

2681
03:13:45,031 --> 03:13:47,922
TRAVIS: Yeah, going in danger close.

2682
03:13:47,922 --> 03:13:48,914
SAM: 13.

2683
03:13:48,914 --> 03:13:50,256
TRAVIS: Nine.

2684
03:13:50,256 --> 03:13:51,341
MARISHA: Oh not great. Nine!

2685
03:13:51,341 --> 03:13:52,363
TALIESIN: Seven.

2686
03:13:52,363 --> 03:13:53,273
LAURA: 19.

2687
03:13:53,273 --> 03:13:54,522
LIAM: 15.

2688
03:13:54,522 --> 03:13:56,174
SAM: 13.

2689
03:13:56,174 --> 03:14:04,625
MATT: Okay, you guys make your way through most of
the Docksward on your way to the large blue tent

2690
03:14:04,625 --> 03:14:08,648
that still stands ominously in the distance.
Thankfully, the moon has come out and cast this

2691
03:14:08,648 --> 03:14:13,115
rimlight against the structure, so it's easy to
see. As you guys are making your way outside of

2692
03:14:13,115 --> 03:14:21,162
the Lochward, you immediately see the approaching
torchlight of crownsguard. One of them you just

2693
03:14:21,162 --> 03:14:27,343
faintly hear 40 or 50 feet ahead of you, "Who goes
there?"

2694
03:14:27,343 --> 03:14:29,672
LAURA: Oh shit.

2695
03:14:29,672 --> 03:14:31,179
SAM: Is there only one guard?

2696
03:14:31,179 --> 03:14:34,822
MATT: It's two guards, side by side. These watches,
they patrol in pairs.

2697
03:14:34,822 --> 03:14:36,638
MARISHA: Are we in like an alleyway, or in the
street?

2698
03:14:36,638 --> 03:14:40,052
MATT: You guys are keeping off to the side. You're
all on the outskirts of the lake and almost made

2699
03:14:40,052 --> 03:14:42,808
your way out of the city towards where the--

2700
03:14:42,808 --> 03:14:44,778
LAURA: Go in the lake. Quick, go into the lake!

2701
03:14:44,778 --> 03:14:47,952
TRAVIS: I cast Disguise Self, and I turn myself
into a crownsguard.

2702
03:14:47,952 --> 03:14:50,668
LIAM: Disguise Self and follow suit.

2703
03:14:50,668 --> 03:14:51,712
MATT: You do as well?

2704
03:14:51,712 --> 03:14:52,575
LIAM: Yeah.

2705
03:14:52,575 --> 03:14:58,483
MATT: All right. So you both become crownsguard.
You've all of a sudden are adorned in the goldish

2706
03:14:58,483 --> 03:15:03,493
brass and red armor.

2707
03:15:03,493 --> 03:15:06,947
TALIESIN: I'm in my black hood. I've got my hood
up now.

2708
03:15:06,947 --> 03:15:08,522
SAM: Anywhere to hide?

2709
03:15:08,522 --> 03:15:13,698
MATT: There are some small alcoves, but you guys
are out in the open, now. They've seen you.

2710
03:15:13,698 --> 03:15:16,101
MARISHA: &lt;i>All&lt;/i> of us?

2711
03:15:16,101 --> 03:15:20,255
MATT: You don't know. They've seen &lt;i>you&lt;/i>. They've
called &lt;i>to&lt;/i> you, and then both of you guys

2712
03:15:20,255 --> 03:15:23,135
disguised yourselves. What are you doing?

2713
03:15:23,135 --> 03:15:27,283
LAURA: I walk into the lake and crouch down?

2714
03:15:27,283 --> 03:15:34,558
MATT: Jester walks up and wades in about six
inches of water and just-- gives her best duck

2715
03:15:34,558 --> 03:15:35,994
impression.

2716
03:15:35,994 --> 03:15:46,885
SAM: I will take off my mask and start attacking
Caleb in a convincing fashion. Not to draw blood

2717
03:15:46,885 --> 03:15:48,104
but-- yeah.

2718
03:15:48,104 --> 03:15:49,488
MATT: Make a deception check.

2719
03:15:49,488 --> 03:15:50,556
SAM: Deception check?

2720
03:15:50,556 --> 03:15:51,682
MATT: Yes.

2721
03:15:51,682 --> 03:15:53,816
SAM: Oh.

2722
03:15:53,816 --> 03:15:59,075
LIAM: Can I start going (groans) Oh get off, you
little beast! To help with the illusion?

2723
03:15:59,075 --> 03:16:01,532
SAM: (snarling noises)

2724
03:16:01,532 --> 03:16:03,484
MATT: Sure, make a deception check.

2725
03:16:03,484 --> 03:16:05,863
SAM: Oh, my deception check was a three minus
three.

2726
03:16:05,863 --> 03:16:07,378
LIAM: But roll with advantage.

2727
03:16:07,378 --> 03:16:08,691
SAM: At advantage?

2728
03:16:08,691 --> 03:16:10,305
LIAM: I'm helping you, you little--

2729
03:16:10,305 --> 03:16:11,761
SAM: Seven minus three!

2730
03:16:11,761 --> 03:16:13,558
LIAM: Oh no!

2731
03:16:13,558 --> 03:16:20,440
MATT: Okay so as soon as these two crownsguard see
this, they go "Shit!" They pull their blades and

2732
03:16:20,440 --> 03:16:25,617
they start charging you, Nott, to try and protect
their other crownsguard--

2733
03:16:25,617 --> 03:16:31,957
LIAM: I take Nott and slam her into a wall as hard
as I can and say: Down you beast!

2734
03:16:31,957 --> 03:16:37,300
MATT: All right, as you rush up in a jog, blades
drawn, one of them is going to go ahead and

2735
03:16:37,300 --> 03:16:38,424
attempt to strike.

2736
03:16:38,424 --> 03:16:43,101
SAM: Oh god! Sure.

2737
03:16:43,101 --> 03:16:45,166
MATT: That is going to be a 14 to hit.

2738
03:16:45,166 --> 03:16:46,341
SAM: Miss!

2739
03:16:46,341 --> 03:16:52,512
MATT: So you manage to (squeaks) and narrowly
dodge the blade as it strikes through the back of

2740
03:16:52,512 --> 03:16:58,432
your cloak and pins it to the side of a wooden
pole that is on the outside of an overhang where

2741
03:16:58,432 --> 03:17:03,505
some of the fish are being left out to dry and
turn into fish jerky. It holds you in place as

2742
03:17:03,505 --> 03:17:07,268
you're snarling and looking scared. The other one
pulls out his blade and says "Where did this thing

2743
03:17:07,268 --> 03:17:08,592
"come from!?"

2744
03:17:08,592 --> 03:17:10,013
LIAM: I have it! And I punch Nott right in the
face.

2745
03:17:10,013 --> 03:17:11,921
SAM: Oh!

2746
03:17:11,921 --> 03:17:16,826
MATT: All right, you take one point of bludgeoning
damage, Nott, and blood just (flowing noise) from

2747
03:17:16,826 --> 03:17:18,105
the nose.

2748
03:17:18,105 --> 03:17:21,502
LIAM: I have this. We're taking these people across
to jail.

2749
03:17:21,502 --> 03:17:25,534
TRAVIS: (Regal voice) Indeed, stay our blade,
please, obviously he can handle this.

2750
03:17:25,534 --> 03:17:28,033
LIAM: Don't you fucking move you little green
piece of filth.

2751
03:17:28,033 --> 03:17:30,695
SAM: (spits)

2752
03:17:30,695 --> 03:17:36,615
TRAVIS: Right in your face! Haha, incredible.

2753
03:17:36,615 --> 03:17:42,620
LIAM: This one is mine, thank you. Beat her within
an inch of her life.

2754
03:17:42,620 --> 03:17:45,542
MATT: I need you to make a deception check on that
one.

2755
03:17:45,542 --> 03:17:49,460
TALIESIN: We are just the worst. This is just
terrible.

2756
03:17:49,460 --> 03:17:50,947
MARISHA: Oh man.

2757
03:17:50,947 --> 03:17:52,050
LIAM: Natural 20.

2758
03:17:52,050 --> 03:17:54,706
(cheering)

2759
03:17:54,706 --> 03:17:59,390
SAM: We've practiced this before. We got this
routine down.

2760
03:17:59,390 --> 03:18:04,979
MATT: You see a look of disappointment come across
the two crownsguards' faces in their inability to

2761
03:18:04,979 --> 03:18:12,136
help you skewer this small, feral creature. They
both put their blades away. "All right if you see

2762
03:18:12,136 --> 03:18:16,254
"anything else, give a shout. (spits)"

2763
03:18:16,254 --> 03:18:17,833
SAM: Ugh.

2764
03:18:17,833 --> 03:18:19,970
MATT: They both continue their walk past the rest
of you.

2765
03:18:19,970 --> 03:18:24,613
LIAM: The rest of you lot fall in line. I drag the
little one off.

2766
03:18:24,613 --> 03:18:27,565
SAM: (snivels)

2767
03:18:27,565 --> 03:18:33,225
MATT: They look over at the tiefling-- partially
crouched in the water.

2768
03:18:33,225 --> 03:18:35,192
SAM: She's taking a shit.

2769
03:18:35,192 --> 03:18:37,283
LAURA: I really had to pee!

2770
03:18:37,283 --> 03:18:40,246
MATT: "Hey! Not in the Ustaloch!"

2771
03:18:40,246 --> 03:18:45,557
(laughter)

2772
03:18:45,557 --> 03:18:59,809
LAURA: Okay. Oh okay. I get out. I stand up and
slowly dredge out of the water.

2773
03:18:59,809 --> 03:19:07,967
MATT: Your legs are soaked from thigh to foot, and
they both eye you warily and slowly walk past.

2774
03:19:07,967 --> 03:19:10,407
LAURA: (sigh of relief)

2775
03:19:10,407 --> 03:19:12,612
MARISHA: It's real cold out.

2776
03:19:12,612 --> 03:19:15,227
LIAM: Have they cleared the way?

2777
03:19:15,227 --> 03:19:21,162
MATT: Eventually, they pass beyond a point where
you feel absolute dread of their presence.

2778
03:19:21,162 --> 03:19:25,129
TRAVIS: Is that a natural thing for you guys to
just attack each other in moments of stress?

2779
03:19:25,129 --> 03:19:27,218
LIAM: Are you all right? I am so very sorry, I'm
so sorry--

2780
03:19:27,218 --> 03:19:32,386
SAM: No, I'm fine that was good acting. You were
perfect. I panicked, I didn't know what to do. I

2781
03:19:32,386 --> 03:19:34,537
was trying to create some sort of distraction.

2782
03:19:34,537 --> 03:19:38,180
LIAM: Let me see your teeth. Okay. You look all
right.

2783
03:19:38,180 --> 03:19:40,231
SAM: They're all over the place.

2784
03:19:40,231 --> 03:19:45,420
(laughter)

2785
03:19:45,420 --> 03:19:48,872
TRAVIS: Oh, I can't tell if that got worse or
better.

2786
03:19:48,872 --> 03:19:52,745
MARISHA: You fixed them a bit!

2787
03:19:52,745 --> 03:19:56,141
LIAM: Okay. Who wants to go to the circus?

2788
03:19:56,141 --> 03:19:58,924
MARISHA: Yay.

2789
03:19:58,924 --> 03:20:02,268
MATT: All right, you guys are make the rest of the
path to the outskirts of the circus. You see at

2790
03:20:02,268 --> 03:20:09,307
the very front flap of it you see a crownsguard
who's like (yawn) sitting there, his arms crossed

2791
03:20:09,307 --> 03:20:13,966
to the front keeping an eye out, he is doing
late-shift. You do see the faint distant

2792
03:20:13,966 --> 03:20:19,729
flickering glow of firelight from the back side of
the circus.

2793
03:20:19,729 --> 03:20:23,733
MARISHA: What is that? Do you guys have like a
nightlight?

2794
03:20:23,733 --> 03:20:25,396
TALIESIN: It's where we camp.

2795
03:20:25,396 --> 03:20:26,924
MATT: Yeah, you saw it earlier, you saw the
campfire.

2796
03:20:26,924 --> 03:20:28,243
MARISHA: Oh sure.

2797
03:20:28,243 --> 03:20:32,128
TRAVIS: If you want to make your ways around, I
could distract them for a moment, have a

2798
03:20:32,128 --> 03:20:33,349
conversation with them.

2799
03:20:33,349 --> 03:20:34,850
MARISHA: Do they still look like crownsguard?

2800
03:20:34,850 --> 03:20:35,882
MATT: Yes.

2801
03:20:35,882 --> 03:20:37,230
TRAVIS: For an hour.

2802
03:20:37,230 --> 03:20:38,981
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

2803
03:20:38,981 --> 03:20:42,343
LIAM: You you want to go with them? I'll go with
him.

2804
03:20:42,343 --> 03:20:48,271
SAM: Sure, but will you be watching me or no? You
don't have to.

2805
03:20:48,271 --> 03:20:49,824
LIAM: Frumpkin will go with you.

2806
03:20:49,824 --> 03:20:56,248
SAM: All right. I'll go with you and-- who else is
going? Are you stealthy?

2807
03:20:56,248 --> 03:20:59,451
LAURA: We'll take care of you. Don't worry!

2808
03:20:59,451 --> 03:21:02,004
TALIESIN: They're not going to talk to you without
&lt;i>me&lt;/i>, so I'm coming, too.

2809
03:21:02,004 --> 03:21:04,299
LIAM: I'm a little jittery, do you want to be a
front man for a little while?

2810
03:21:04,299 --> 03:21:05,429
TRAVIS: Sure I got it, yeah.

2811
03:21:05,429 --> 03:21:06,977
LIAM: Okay.

2812
03:21:06,977 --> 03:21:09,034
MATT: All right, so what are the groups here?

2813
03:21:09,034 --> 03:21:10,552
SAM: The girls and the boys.

2814
03:21:10,552 --> 03:21:11,882
TRAVIS: Caleb and me--

2815
03:21:11,882 --> 03:21:13,103
LAURA: And Molly.

2816
03:21:13,103 --> 03:21:14,788
SAM: And whatever Molly is.

2817
03:21:14,788 --> 03:21:15,965
(laughter)

2818
03:21:15,965 --> 03:21:17,533
TALIESIN: I'm fabulous.

2819
03:21:17,533 --> 03:21:19,200
MATT: Molly, who are you going with?

2820
03:21:19,200 --> 03:21:22,690
TALIESIN: I'm going with the girls, because the
circus kids won't talk to them without me.

2821
03:21:22,690 --> 03:21:26,844
MATT: All right, so the three of you are going
forward. What are you doing? I guess I should

2822
03:21:26,844 --> 03:21:27,763
ask.

2823
03:21:27,763 --> 03:21:32,933
TRAVIS: I walk up to the guard. (regal voice) It's
a late night, not much action this evening. See

2824
03:21:32,933 --> 03:21:35,147
anything unusual?

2825
03:21:35,147 --> 03:21:42,114
MATT: "Eh, nothing yet. Mostly I hate this. Ugh, I
just wish this whole fucking circus would just go.

2826
03:21:42,114 --> 03:21:44,340
"I need to sleep. Regular hours."

2827
03:21:44,340 --> 03:21:46,324
TRAVIS: Yeah, have you heard heard? 
How long are they supposed to be here?

2828
03:21:46,324 --> 03:21:50,362
MATT: "Until they finish this fucking
investigation. They keep bugging people for

2829
03:21:50,362 --> 03:21:54,262
"information, but they're all just clammed up and
not saying shit."

2830
03:21:54,262 --> 03:21:56,406
TRAVIS: At least you're by the tent, they've had
us walking the perimeter of the lake the entire

2831
03:21:56,406 --> 03:21:57,498
time.

2832
03:21:57,498 --> 03:22:04,170
MATT: "It's bullshit. I wish they would just go
ahead and execute them. That carnival master or

2833
03:22:04,170 --> 03:22:05,916
whatever and get it over with."

2834
03:22:05,916 --> 03:22:09,476
TRAVIS: Did they find anything inside, today? Tell
me, &lt;i>something&lt;/i> interesting, please.

2835
03:22:09,476 --> 03:22:13,222
MATT: "They investigated the corpses and found
nothing yet. Still in there if you want to take a

2836
03:22:13,222 --> 03:22:14,637
look at it."

2837
03:22:14,637 --> 03:22:17,075
TRAVIS: Would you mind if we popped in?

2838
03:22:17,075 --> 03:22:22,947
MATT: "I mean I suppose so." Make a deception
check.

2839
03:22:22,947 --> 03:22:26,072
MARISHA: Something good, something good?

2840
03:22:26,072 --> 03:22:27,615
TALIESIN: No.

2841
03:22:27,615 --> 03:22:31,227
TRAVIS: Where is it? Jesus.

2842
03:22:31,227 --> 03:22:32,700
Oh! 13.

2843
03:22:32,700 --> 03:22:41,174
MATT: Okay. He thinks a second on it. "Oh I
suppose so. Go on in."

2844
03:22:41,174 --> 03:22:43,790
TRAVIS: We'll be quick, super fast.

2845
03:22:43,790 --> 03:22:51,710
MATT: "Please, get it over with." He stops you.
"If there's any way to expedite this, if you can

2846
03:22:51,710 --> 03:22:56,700
"pin it on any of them, we can just kill them and
take care of it. Let me know."

2847
03:22:56,700 --> 03:22:59,513
TRAVIS: Let's go.

2848
03:22:59,513 --> 03:23:04,495
(as Grog) That worked way better
than I thought. Like we should-- I mean--

2849
03:23:04,495 --> 03:23:07,433
(as Fjord) should we look around for stuff or what?

2850
03:23:07,433 --> 03:23:10,389
(laughter)

2851
03:23:10,389 --> 03:23:12,611
SAM: Yes. Yes.

2852
03:23:12,611 --> 03:23:16,465
LIAM: You are very good with voices.

2853
03:23:16,465 --> 03:23:19,781
TRAVIS: Well you know, I do a little mimicry here
and there. We should look, come on. Check the

2854
03:23:19,781 --> 03:23:22,709
grounds. Maybe we can find where the bodies are
laying.

2855
03:23:22,709 --> 03:23:24,520
LIAM: Yeah, let's have a look around.

2856
03:23:24,520 --> 03:23:31,028
MATT: You guys look inside, the tent is dark.
There's no light inside.

2857
03:23:31,028 --> 03:23:41,195
LIAM: I take a rag out of my side satchel and I
cast-- what the hell is it called because I've

2858
03:23:41,195 --> 03:23:46,388
only been a wizard for a short time-- one Dancing
Light underneath the rags so it's only dim.

2859
03:23:46,388 --> 03:23:52,367
MATT: All right, so you have this self-made hooded
lantern with the hood you have over it.

2860
03:23:52,367 --> 03:23:53,131
LIAM: Yeah.

2861
03:23:53,131 --> 03:23:54,715
MATT: Okay.

2862
03:23:54,715 --> 03:23:56,856
MARISHA: That's dope.

2863
03:23:56,856 --> 03:23:59,166
LIAM: What the fuck are we looking for in here?

2864
03:23:59,166 --> 03:24:00,655
MATT: And Nott, you're going with them?

2865
03:24:00,655 --> 03:24:02,027
SAM: I'm with the girls.

2866
03:24:02,027 --> 03:24:03,960
TRAVS: Where did the bodies fall? Over there,
didn't they?

2867
03:24:03,960 --> 03:24:05,322
LIAM: That's right, yeah.

2868
03:24:05,322 --> 03:24:07,220
TRAVIS: Well let's search the grounds.

2869
03:24:07,220 --> 03:24:10,155
MATT: You make your way inside, the smell is
pretty bad. You can smell the flesh beginning to

2870
03:24:10,155 --> 03:24:11,282
decay.

2871
03:24:11,282 --> 03:24:13,280
TRAVIS: Have they moved the bodies or are the
bodies still there?

2872
03:24:13,280 --> 03:24:18,363
MATT: With a bit of looking, the bodies are still
there where they left them. They have not moved,

2873
03:24:18,363 --> 03:24:23,679
you can see a couple of remnants of notes and
sheets that have been crumpled, but the bodies

2874
03:24:23,679 --> 03:24:27,014
have been left where they are.

2875
03:24:27,014 --> 03:24:34,842
TRAVIS: Can we check the bodies for anything?

2876
03:24:34,842 --> 03:24:43,861
LIAM: Is there anything arcane? From all my
studies, does anything here ring any bell? I have

2877
03:24:43,861 --> 03:24:45,476
a photographic memory.

2878
03:24:45,476 --> 03:24:50,113
MATT: Go and make a religion check.

2879
03:24:50,113 --> 03:24:54,974
LIAM: All right. That is a ten.

2880
03:24:54,974 --> 03:24:59,450
MATT: Unfortunately, you don't have a lot of
research on the undead, or whatever might be the

2881
03:24:59,450 --> 03:25:03,881
essence of this creature's creation, and the more
you look at it, you're like, "This is not my

2882
03:25:03,881 --> 03:25:05,441
specialty."

2883
03:25:05,441 --> 03:25:09,500
LIAM: Okay. What about the perimeters of here,
where all the people were? There was a swarm of

2884
03:25:09,500 --> 03:25:13,108
people. I spend five minutes seeing anything was
dropped of interest.

2885
03:25:13,108 --> 03:25:16,599
MATT: Make an investigation check, both of you.

2886
03:25:16,599 --> 03:25:18,878
TRAVIS: That's better.

2887
03:25:18,878 --> 03:25:20,481
LIAM: I miss the twins.

2888
03:25:20,481 --> 03:25:21,793
TRAVIS: 16.

2889
03:25:21,793 --> 03:25:23,441
LIAM: Big ten.

2890
03:25:23,441 --> 03:25:28,037
MATT: Glancing about, you can see the track marks
of everyone fleeing. You can see the spatters of

2891
03:25:28,037 --> 03:25:34,886
blood. You can see the place where the
transformation occurred. There is a horrible

2892
03:25:34,886 --> 03:25:44,201
shedding of certain layers of flesh. You can see
previously existing layers of flesh and muscle

2893
03:25:44,201 --> 03:25:54,457
that were shed as whatever this undead thing was
fell to the ground. Once again, you make a

2894
03:25:54,457 --> 03:25:58,915
religion check as well.

2895
03:25:58,915 --> 03:26:01,659
TRAVIS: Okay. Roll high. I did not. Ten.

2896
03:26:01,659 --> 03:26:07,343
MATT: Yeah. This is not your specialty. You have
little experience with the undead and this type of

2897
03:26:07,343 --> 03:26:08,246
magic.

2898
03:26:08,246 --> 03:26:11,448
TRAVIS: We can't spend that long in here. Maybe we
just take a bit of it with us. Do you have a

2899
03:26:11,448 --> 03:26:13,619
pocket?

2900
03:26:13,619 --> 03:26:16,261
LIAM: I have many pockets, of course I have
pockets.

2901
03:26:16,261 --> 03:26:19,694
TRAVIS: Like a jar? I-I got no pockets!

2902
03:26:19,694 --> 03:26:24,495
SAM: You designed a character with no pockets?!
Why would you do that?

2903
03:26:24,495 --> 03:26:27,744
TRAVIS: There's no pockets! All right, but I'll
check.

2904
03:26:27,744 --> 03:26:30,916
LIAM: He's just in the Blue Man Group unitard and
that's it.

2905
03:26:30,916 --> 03:26:34,543
MARISHA: I'm sure Rob Liefeld just got a nosebleed
and he doesn't know why.

2906
03:26:34,543 --> 03:26:41,002
LIAM: So this dead thing is here in front of me?

2907
03:26:41,002 --> 03:26:44,661
MATT: Two of them. There's the main one, the
ground zero one, which is where you were putting

2908
03:26:44,661 --> 03:26:47,753
all your attention, and then there's the woman,
who was transformed as part of the first.

2909
03:26:47,753 --> 03:26:55,251
LIAM: I will take my dagger, and I will slice a
little bit off of the woman, and it's going to get

2910
03:26:55,251 --> 03:27:01,720
dark in here and I will snuff out the light and
use the rag to roll it up and I'll put the little

2911
03:27:01,720 --> 03:27:03,845
piece in my pack.

2912
03:27:03,845 --> 03:27:10,727
MATT: With a squishy sound you place it within
your pack.

2913
03:27:10,727 --> 03:27:12,320
LIAM: Let's get out of here, I'm going to be
sick.

2914
03:27:12,320 --> 03:27:13,435
TRAVIS: Agreed.

2915
03:27:13,435 --> 03:27:20,697
MATT: All right. The four of you, I need you to
roll stealth checks, please.

2916
03:27:20,697 --> 03:27:26,112
MARISHA: Not that one. I don't feel good about it.
Oh not bad! 21.

2917
03:27:26,112 --> 03:27:27,231
TALIESIN: 17.

2918
03:27:27,231 --> 03:27:28,429
LAURA: 18.

2919
03:27:28,429 --> 03:27:29,906
SAM: 25.

2920
03:27:29,906 --> 03:27:35,200
MATT: Without issue, you guys quickly dart around
the side of the tent and make your way right

2921
03:27:35,200 --> 03:27:40,763
towards the central area where the multitude of
tents to this back encampment is placed. There is

2922
03:27:40,763 --> 03:27:47,969
a single campfire. The embers are burning out. It
has not been kept up. You do see two crownsguard

2923
03:27:47,969 --> 03:27:51,896
who are currently keeping watch. One of them is
slumped in a chair across from the fire and is

2924
03:27:51,896 --> 03:27:59,171
nodding off. The other is doing a basic patrol and
looking around. Other than that, you don't hear

2925
03:27:59,171 --> 03:28:06,385
any sounds, you don't see anybody else. Just the
two crownsguard.

2926
03:28:06,385 --> 03:28:10,668
TALIESIN: Which of the tents is currently
occupied?

2927
03:28:10,668 --> 03:28:16,843
MATT: There are four main tents. There are two
very large ones, one of which generally contains

2928
03:28:16,843 --> 03:28:24,027
Toya and Kylre, the devil toad. That's on the
south side. There's the north largest tent, this

2929
03:28:24,027 --> 03:28:32,507
one contains the Knot sisters and Ornna. Then
there's a very small tent to the south side that

2930
03:28:32,507 --> 03:28:40,379
would be Bo the Breaker's tent, but he's not here.
Then there's a medium sized tent on the north

2931
03:28:40,379 --> 03:28:49,002
side. Who would be in that one?

2932
03:28:49,002 --> 03:28:55,668
TALIESIN: Toya and Kylre share a tent, that's
right. It would be Desmond.

2933
03:28:55,668 --> 03:28:59,525
MATT: Desmond would be the other one. It would be
Gustav staying there as well, but Gustav changes

2934
03:28:59,525 --> 03:29:02,325
between the tent and the cart.

2935
03:29:02,325 --> 03:29:04,063
MARISHA: The cart?

2936
03:29:04,063 --> 03:29:05,826
TALIESIN: We have a wagon.

2937
03:29:05,826 --> 03:29:10,929
LAURA: Molly, I have a question. What made you
guys set up your tent here?

2938
03:29:10,929 --> 03:29:13,754
TALIESIN: We were told to set it up here, if I
recall.

2939
03:29:13,754 --> 03:29:18,020
LAURA: In this specific area?

2940
03:29:18,020 --> 03:29:21,980
TALIESIN: That sounds right. If I recall, we were
specifically told to set up tent right here.

2941
03:29:21,980 --> 03:29:24,293
MARISHA: And it's by the lake, right?

2942
03:29:24,293 --> 03:29:28,159
MATT: Maybe 150-200 feet away from it.

2943
03:29:28,159 --> 03:29:30,688
MARISHA: That's pretty close to a lake.

2944
03:29:30,688 --> 03:29:36,390
LAURA: What if they set up their tent on a cursed
land or something?

2945
03:29:36,390 --> 03:29:41,593
MARISHA: It's the lake, it's common?

2946
03:29:41,593 --> 03:29:46,228
TALIESIN: What's the easiest tent to get to
without--

2947
03:29:46,228 --> 03:29:49,006
MATT: Do you want to go to the north side or the
south side of the main tent?

2948
03:29:49,006 --> 03:29:51,052
TALIESIN: I want to go with whatever's furthest
away from the guards.

2949
03:29:51,052 --> 03:29:53,387
SAM: Shouldn't we just go to the Toya tent?

2950
03:29:53,387 --> 03:29:56,029
MATT: The Toya tent's on the south side, that's
the opposite side, you guys would have probably

2951
03:29:56,029 --> 03:29:57,475
come in from the north end.

2952
03:29:57,475 --> 03:29:59,046
TALIESIN: What's the easiest to get to without--

2953
03:29:59,046 --> 03:30:03,251
MATT: That would be the one that contains Ornna
and the Knot sisters.

2954
03:30:03,251 --> 03:30:09,786
TALIESIN: I'm going to go back there and do our
traditional (bird call)

2955
03:30:09,786 --> 03:30:15,483
MATT: Okay. There's actually no response.

2956
03:30:15,483 --> 03:30:21,504
LAURA: (bird call)

2957
03:30:21,504 --> 03:30:27,216
MARISHA: I had Mona and Lena, but maybe it's
Lolie.

2958
03:30:27,216 --> 03:30:35,940
TALIESIN: Yuli. It's Mona and Yuli. I'm going to
try one of the other tents. Am I getting the sense

2959
03:30:35,940 --> 03:30:40,215
that any of them are in?

2960
03:30:40,215 --> 03:30:41,495
SAM: Look over here!

2961
03:30:41,495 --> 03:30:43,144
TALIESIN: Over here!

2962
03:30:43,144 --> 03:30:46,453
MATT: The other tent you get to and you make the
same sound? This would be the one that Desmond

2963
03:30:46,453 --> 03:30:52,245
usually is in, too. There's a pause, and then you
hear a very faint (bird call).

2964
03:30:52,245 --> 03:30:58,175
TALIESIN: I'm going to very gently lift the back
of the tent up and not go in through the front.

2965
03:30:58,175 --> 03:30:59,540
And just--

2966
03:30:59,540 --> 03:31:04,915
MATT: Okay. You glance inside and you can see,
leaning up from a bedroll, Desmond who is

2967
03:31:04,915 --> 03:31:13,569
half-awake, and glances over and sees you. He's
out of outfit, out of makeup, and he gives a nod.

2968
03:31:13,569 --> 03:31:19,408
TALIESIN: (whispering) Do you know what's going
on? (switches to normal volume) Assume we're

2969
03:31:19,408 --> 03:31:20,721
whispering, because this is bullshit.

2970
03:31:20,721 --> 03:31:22,673
MATT: Yeah.

2971
03:31:22,673 --> 03:31:25,850
TALIESIN: How is it? What's happened?

2972
03:31:25,850 --> 03:31:31,858
MATT: "They've come around asking a few questions,
we're trying to figure it out ourselves. Are you

2973
03:31:31,858 --> 03:31:32,861
"okay?"

2974
03:31:32,861 --> 03:31:35,032
TALIESIN: I could be worse.

2975
03:31:35,032 --> 03:31:37,475
MATT: "How's Gustav? And Bosun?"

2976
03:31:37,475 --> 03:31:51,531
TALIESIN: They couldn't be worse. And then Yasha
Yasha'd. I don't know. Did Toya see anything? Did

2977
03:31:51,531 --> 03:31:55,615
she say anything?

2978
03:31:55,615 --> 03:32:02,263
MATT: "We're still trying to figure this out
ourselves. Are you alone?"

2979
03:32:02,263 --> 03:32:06,495
TALIESIN: No, I've picked up a few scragglers.
They're idiots, but they're helping.

2980
03:32:06,495 --> 03:32:08,311
MATT: "Well bring them in."

2981
03:32:08,311 --> 03:32:10,854
SAM: We come in.

2982
03:32:10,854 --> 03:32:14,586
MATT: You guys all enter the tent and you see
Desmond. Previously you saw him in this very

2983
03:32:14,586 --> 03:32:20,145
colorful outfit with the frilled neck piece and
the full facial makeup. Now you see a man in his

2984
03:32:20,145 --> 03:32:25,108
late 30s with a very scarred left side of his
face. It looks like it was shredded at one point

2985
03:32:25,108 --> 03:32:31,474
in his youth, that the makeup hid during the
performance. As soon as you enter, even upon

2986
03:32:31,474 --> 03:32:41,844
greeting him, he has a very sad presence to him.
Even though you're all under the cover of night

2987
03:32:41,844 --> 03:32:49,309
and having this conspiratorial conversation, he
has this melancholy about him that permeates the

2988
03:32:49,309 --> 03:32:58,396
space inside the tent. He says, "So you're all the
ones that helped earlier. Thank you. It would have

2989
03:32:58,396 --> 03:33:00,655
"been far worse if you hadn't."

2990
03:33:00,655 --> 03:33:03,528
LAURA: No problem.

2991
03:33:03,528 --> 03:33:06,159
TALIESIN: What do they think happened? What are
they asking?

2992
03:33:06,159 --> 03:33:11,952
MATT: "They're thinking something about the show.
They're thinking Gustav made this happen. I don't

2993
03:33:11,952 --> 03:33:19,786
think it's Gustav, he's a good man. He makes poor
choices and it's plagued him his whole life, you

2994
03:33:19,786 --> 03:33:29,578
can see it in his brow. But good intentions have
grave consequences. No one that good comes out of

2995
03:33:29,578 --> 03:33:36,020
Shady Creek Run without some mistakes behind them,
but I don't see him doing this."

2996
03:33:36,020 --> 03:33:38,212
TALIESIN: What would be the point?

2997
03:33:38,212 --> 03:33:40,268
LAURA: Has it ever happened like this before?

2998
03:33:40,268 --> 03:33:41,322
MATT: "No."

2999
03:33:41,322 --> 03:33:43,611
LAURA: Anything weird ever happened before?

3000
03:33:43,611 --> 03:33:47,954
MATT: "Weird things? All the time. We're a bunch
of weird folk, work with a lot of weird people.

3001
03:33:47,954 --> 03:33:52,938
Bunch of strange freaks gathered to this show."

3002
03:33:52,938 --> 03:33:57,163
MARISHA: Was there anyone new here recently that
you haven't worked with a lot?

3003
03:33:57,163 --> 03:33:59,466
MATT: "Yeah, she apparently ran off."

3004
03:33:59,466 --> 03:34:04,208
TALIESIN: Yasha's the newest, but she can be
flighty.

3005
03:34:04,208 --> 03:34:11,751
MARISHA: What about Mona and Yuli?

3006
03:34:11,751 --> 03:34:17,048
MATT: "The sisters are bitter, but it's no fault
of theirs."

3007
03:34:17,048 --> 03:34:19,311
MARISHA: Why are they bitter?

3008
03:34:19,311 --> 03:34:21,332
MATT: "Because the world is cruel."

3009
03:34:21,332 --> 03:34:23,359
TALIESIN: You've never met it-- Well, nevermind.

3010
03:34:23,359 --> 03:34:25,668
MATT: "I wish I could help them, but it--"

3011
03:34:25,668 --> 03:34:29,632
MARISHA: (stutters) What happened to them?

3012
03:34:29,632 --> 03:34:31,902
LAURA: Are you drunk? What's going on?

3013
03:34:31,902 --> 03:34:35,126
MARISHA: No, I'm trying to hear and whisper at the
same time.

3014
03:34:35,126 --> 03:34:38,876
LAURA: You can talk at a normal volume.

3015
03:34:38,876 --> 03:34:40,594
MATT: Magical whisper. Cone of Whisper.

3016
03:34:40,594 --> 03:34:43,309
MARISHA: Matt Cone of Whisper!

3017
03:34:43,309 --> 03:34:45,583
TALIESIN: Oh God, that's a new thing now.

3018
03:34:45,583 --> 03:34:50,092
MARISHA: What did they say? Why do they think
that? Why is the world shitty?

3019
03:34:50,092 --> 03:34:53,329
MATT: "Have you been around? Have you travelled to
see anything?"

3020
03:34:53,329 --> 03:34:59,245
MARISHA: Yeah. Listen. The world has its own brand
of shitty depending on whose eyes are looking at

3021
03:34:59,245 --> 03:35:04,639
it, right? So what is their brand of shitty?

3022
03:35:04,639 --> 03:35:05,922
TALIESIN: Circus shitty.

3023
03:35:05,922 --> 03:35:09,875
MATT: "I don't know. Ask them."

3024
03:35:09,875 --> 03:35:11,486
MARISHA: Where are they?

3025
03:35:11,486 --> 03:35:13,729
TALIESIN: In a tent over there.

3026
03:35:13,729 --> 03:35:18,590
MATT: "They don't seem to take much of a liking to
me anyway, so I can't really tell you myself. I'm

3027
03:35:18,590 --> 03:35:19,700
"sorry."

3028
03:35:19,700 --> 03:35:21,852
SAM: They don't like you? Why?

3029
03:35:21,852 --> 03:35:24,861
MATT: "There's a lot of people that don't like
me."

3030
03:35:24,861 --> 03:35:27,486
LAURA: I like you, Desmond. I think you're great.

3031
03:35:27,486 --> 03:35:29,745
SAM: Why? What did you do?

3032
03:35:29,745 --> 03:35:34,319
MATT: He looks at you and goes, "Same reason folks
probably don't like you; you're different."

3033
03:35:34,319 --> 03:35:36,703
SAM: Hmm.

3034
03:35:36,703 --> 03:35:40,074
TALIESIN: Is everybody still here? They've not
taken anyone away other than--

3035
03:35:40,074 --> 03:35:42,914
MATT: "Other than those two, everyone else is
here. We're just keeping under watch until their

3036
03:35:42,914 --> 03:35:44,861
"investigation is complete."

3037
03:35:44,861 --> 03:35:51,203
MARISHA: Molly, why did you laugh when I asked
about the sisters?

3038
03:35:51,203 --> 03:36:00,842
TALIESIN: We're carnival people, we've all got our
issues. You don't end up here if you're not

3039
03:36:00,842 --> 03:36:02,879
a little weird.

3040
03:36:02,879 --> 03:36:09,123
LAURA: Can I try something? I want to try to cast
Detect Good and Evil.

3041
03:36:09,123 --> 03:36:10,149
MATT: Okay.

3042
03:36:10,149 --> 03:36:11,534
LIAM: Cleric shit!

3043
03:36:11,534 --> 03:36:12,703
LAURA: Right?

3044
03:36:12,703 --> 03:36:13,636
SAM: On?

3045
03:36:13,636 --> 03:36:20,674
LAURA: On the area. It lasts up to ten minutes, so
it's within 30 feet of me.

3046
03:36:20,674 --> 03:36:21,686
TRAVIS: You ever cast this before?

3047
03:36:21,686 --> 03:36:22,282
LAURA: No.

3048
03:36:22,282 --> 03:36:24,365
TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and MARISHA: First cast!

3049
03:36:24,365 --> 03:36:28,058
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: First blood!

3050
03:36:28,058 --> 03:36:33,891
MATT: So you cast it. You concentrate. You reach
down and grasp the bottom of your symbol that

3051
03:36:33,891 --> 03:36:46,238
hangs around your belt, and there's a faint rush
of divine force given to your consciousness. You

3052
03:36:46,238 --> 03:36:54,685
don't sense within 30 feet of you any fiendish, or
celestial, or fey, or undead, or aberration.

3053
03:36:54,685 --> 03:36:57,075
LAURA: Nothing that's been desecrated?

3054
03:36:57,075 --> 03:36:59,664
MATT: Nothing from this tent or within 30 feet.

3055
03:36:59,664 --> 03:37:00,989
SAM: Does it follow her?

3056
03:37:00,989 --> 03:37:01,989
LAURA: Yeah, it follows me.

3057
03:37:01,989 --> 03:37:03,513
MATT: It's like a radial thing.

3058
03:37:03,513 --> 03:37:05,977
SAM: That's pretty cool, let's keep going then.
Maybe we'll see something?

3059
03:37:05,977 --> 03:37:12,911
LAURA: Yeah. Am I close to the edge of the main
tent?

3060
03:37:12,911 --> 03:37:17,831
MATT: There are two tents to the north. There's a
bigger one, and a medium one. The one that you're

3061
03:37:17,831 --> 03:37:22,906
in right now is the larger one to the north, and
as such contains-- Actually no. The one that you

3062
03:37:22,906 --> 03:37:26,783
guys are in right now is the medium one. The one
that contains Desmond. The larger one contains

3063
03:37:26,783 --> 03:37:30,022
both of the sisters and Ornna.

3064
03:37:30,022 --> 03:37:34,938
LAURA: Okay. And they're closer to the big tent?
Where is the big tent?

3065
03:37:34,938 --> 03:37:37,698
MATT: Correct. The big tent is about ten to 15
feet from the one you're in right now.

3066
03:37:37,698 --> 03:37:43,931
LAURA: Okay, cool. Yeah, let's leave. I'll get up
to the edge of the big tent, and I want to see if

3067
03:37:43,931 --> 03:37:46,665
I can feel anything weird in that area.

3068
03:37:46,665 --> 03:37:48,386
MATT: Okay. Is everyone else staying inside or are
you going with her?

3069
03:37:48,386 --> 03:37:54,320
SAM: We're going with, but before we leave I'll
ask Desmond: From one outcast to another, are

3070
03:37:54,320 --> 03:38:02,003
there any questions that are bugging &lt;i>you&lt;/i>
about all this?

3071
03:38:02,003 --> 03:38:09,054
MATT: He thinks for a second. "I don't want this
all to fall on Gustav. He's done a lot of good for"

3072
03:38:09,054 --> 03:38:13,286
"all of us, and the way they're talking about the
investigation, they're looking to make a scapegoat"

3073
03:38:13,286 --> 03:38:18,507
"of this."

3074
03:38:18,507 --> 03:38:20,950
SAM: Well, thank you.

3075
03:38:20,950 --> 03:38:22,470
MATT: "Thank you."

3076
03:38:22,470 --> 03:38:34,159
SAM: (mimics bird call poorly) That's how they
talk to each other. That's how carnival folk talk

3077
03:38:34,159 --> 03:38:36,481
to each other.

3078
03:38:36,481 --> 03:38:41,870
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's sake. I'm going to do my
best.

3079
03:38:41,870 --> 03:38:43,518
MATT: "Thank you."

3080
03:38:43,518 --> 03:38:48,335
TALIESIN: I'm going to quietly sneak out the back
of the tent again and sneak into the--

3081
03:38:48,335 --> 03:38:49,986
MATT: Another stealth check, my friends.

3082
03:38:49,986 --> 03:38:54,066
TALIESIN: Oh god, I hate all of this.

3083
03:38:54,066 --> 03:39:00,488
LAURA: I'm going to give Molly Blessing, so you
get advantage.

3084
03:39:00,488 --> 03:39:02,034
SAM: 21.

3085
03:39:02,034 --> 03:39:04,102
MARISHA: 13. Not great.

3086
03:39:04,102 --> 03:39:05,564
TALIESIN: 13.

3087
03:39:05,564 --> 03:39:06,343
MATT: With advantage?

3088
03:39:06,343 --> 03:39:07,507
TALIESIN: With advantage.

3089
03:39:07,507 --> 03:39:08,578
LAURA: 12.

3090
03:39:08,578 --> 03:39:19,220
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way up to the edge
of the tent.

3091
03:39:19,220 --> 03:39:20,695
TALIESIN: I'm not going to make the noise I'm just
going to--

3092
03:39:20,695 --> 03:39:25,120
MATT: Right. As you make your way over to the edge
of the tent where the sisters and Ornna are, you

3093
03:39:25,120 --> 03:39:34,532
focus and concentrate. Nothing, from the radial
thing. One of the guards, who's standing up and

3094
03:39:34,532 --> 03:39:42,237
making a patrol, looks over right as you duck
behind and you hear a "Huh?"

3095
03:39:42,237 --> 03:39:45,481
SAM: Uh oh.

3096
03:39:45,481 --> 03:39:46,400
LAURA: Quick, go in the tent.

3097
03:39:46,400 --> 03:39:48,138
TALIESIN: We're going to go in the tent.

3098
03:39:48,138 --> 03:39:51,816
LAURA: We all duck under the tent go and act like
we're sleeping.

3099
03:39:51,816 --> 03:39:55,096
MATT: You guys all dodge under the tent just as
the guard begins to pass around. You hear the

3100
03:39:55,096 --> 03:39:58,807
footsteps around. As you step in you watch as the
two Knot sisters--

3101
03:39:58,807 --> 03:40:01,797
TALIESIN: (shushes)

3102
03:40:01,797 --> 03:40:06,316
MATT: They both curl into a ball and stay really
quiet. All of the sudden Ornna comes to

3103
03:40:06,316 --> 03:40:15,111
consciousness and (light footsteps)

3104
03:40:15,111 --> 03:40:22,599
the footsteps finish the circle
and then go back towards where the fire is.

3105
03:40:22,599 --> 03:40:23,924
LAURA: That was close.

3106
03:40:23,924 --> 03:40:27,441
MATT: Ornna leans in, goes like, "Okay, what is
going on."

3107
03:40:27,441 --> 03:40:31,962
TALIESIN: That's what I'm trying to figure out,
what the fuck is going on. They're with me, it's

3108
03:40:31,962 --> 03:40:41,260
been complicated. Gustav's in deep. Bosun's in
deep.

3109
03:40:41,260 --> 03:40:43,921
LAURA: Tell us you know something.

3110
03:40:43,921 --> 03:40:45,060
MATT: "What do you want to know?"

3111
03:40:45,060 --> 03:40:46,450
TALIESIN: What did you see? I don't know.

3112
03:40:46,450 --> 03:40:50,529
SAM: Who did this? What was it?

3113
03:40:50,529 --> 03:40:55,453
MATT: "I don't know. I looked and I saw what you
saw."

3114
03:40:55,453 --> 03:40:56,657
TALIESIN: This is Ornna I assume.

3115
03:40:56,657 --> 03:40:57,617
MATT: This is Ornna, yeah.

3116
03:40:57,617 --> 03:40:58,838
TALIESIN: Ornna is the fire dancer.

3117
03:40:58,838 --> 03:41:00,503
MARISHA: Right, okay.

3118
03:41:00,503 --> 03:41:05,728
TALIESIN: For fuck's sake, they're going
to kill every last fucking one of us unless

3119
03:41:05,728 --> 03:41:07,619
we figure this out.

3120
03:41:07,619 --> 03:41:08,849
MATT: She's like, "Right."

3121
03:41:08,849 --> 03:41:10,007
TALIESIN: What do you think?

3122
03:41:10,007 --> 03:41:14,168
MATT: "Well the sister's over here think it's a
hit job, but this isn't a hit job with zombies?

3123
03:41:14,168 --> 03:41:17,418
"Are you fucking kidding me?"

3124
03:41:17,418 --> 03:41:22,783
TALIESIN: I don't know. I think that they're
trying to cover something.

3125
03:41:22,783 --> 03:41:25,515
MATT: "That's not surprising."

3126
03:41:25,515 --> 03:41:29,206
MARISHA: Can I insight check the sisters? What are
they doing right now?

3127
03:41:29,206 --> 03:41:31,905
MATT: They're both just quietly curled up and
watching you guys talk.

3128
03:41:31,905 --> 03:41:33,031
MARISHA: They're not saying anything, though?

3129
03:41:33,031 --> 03:41:35,504
MATT: Not yet. If you want to ask them something
you can.

3130
03:41:35,504 --> 03:41:37,709
MARISHA: Do they look nervous or are they just
being shifty?

3131
03:41:37,709 --> 03:41:39,054
MATT: Make an insight check to find out.

3132
03:41:39,054 --> 03:41:40,352
MARISHA: Yeah.

3133
03:41:40,352 --> 03:41:43,443
LAURA: While she's doing that I'm going to try and
sneak out the underside of the tent to go to the

3134
03:41:43,443 --> 03:41:46,375
big tent.

3135
03:41:46,375 --> 03:41:48,483
SAM: I'll go with her.

3136
03:41:48,483 --> 03:41:55,720
MATT: This is a bit of a leap. This goes about 25,
30 feet south of where you are around the campfire

3137
03:41:55,720 --> 03:41:57,095
that's open.

3138
03:41:57,095 --> 03:41:59,531
SAM: No problem.

3139
03:41:59,531 --> 03:42:03,074
MATT: Go ahead and make your stealth checks,
guys.

3140
03:42:03,074 --> 03:42:07,502
TALIESIN: Oh god. I miss Pass Without a Trace so
much.

3141
03:42:07,502 --> 03:42:12,131
SAM: 23.

3142
03:42:12,131 --> 03:42:15,938
TALIESIN: That's a number.

3143
03:42:15,938 --> 03:42:19,694
LAURA: Nine.

3144
03:42:19,694 --> 03:42:26,174
MATT: Okay. What was your insight check?

3145
03:42:26,174 --> 03:42:27,349
MARISHA: 15.

3146
03:42:27,349 --> 03:42:32,498
MATT: 15. They both look nervous, but just
untrusting of the scenario. You can't read

3147
03:42:32,498 --> 03:42:41,819
anything deeper than that. There is definitely a,
hmm, but you can't quite get a full bead on them.

3148
03:42:41,819 --> 03:42:46,121
You guys, as you curl around the outside, there's
the one guard that's sitting in the chair by the

3149
03:42:46,121 --> 03:42:53,645
fire that goes like (snores) and opens his eyes a
little bit and looks over in your direction,

3150
03:42:53,645 --> 03:43:01,441
Jester, and there's a brief moment where he's just
looking right at you. Do you do anything?

3151
03:43:01,441 --> 03:43:06,900
LAURA: I freeze.

3152
03:43:06,900 --> 03:43:11,322
SAM: Oh god.

3153
03:43:11,322 --> 03:43:12,706
MATT: Stands up.

3154
03:43:12,706 --> 03:43:18,371
LAURA: Can I use-- oh shit. I'm going shitballs,
shit.

3155
03:43:18,371 --> 03:43:21,977
SAM: I'm just tucking around, getting ready.

3156
03:43:21,977 --> 03:43:23,265
MATT: You're around, you don't see anything.

3157
03:43:23,265 --> 03:43:25,615
SAM: I don't see this?

3158
03:43:25,615 --> 03:43:27,058
MATT: Sorry, he doesn't see you.

3159
03:43:27,058 --> 03:43:32,648
LAURA: I'm going to cast Charm Person on the guard
that sees me.

3160
03:43:32,648 --> 03:43:39,295
MATT: Okay. As he stands up, he goes toward you
and he goes for his blade and he has to make a

3161
03:43:39,295 --> 03:43:40,307
saving throw.

3162
03:43:40,307 --> 03:43:41,899
SAM: Oh boy.

3163
03:43:41,899 --> 03:43:45,692
MATT: Which he does not make. I don't think so,
it's like a six.

3164
03:43:45,692 --> 03:43:47,977
SAM: No, it's like 13 or something.

3165
03:43:47,977 --> 03:43:49,021
LAURA: Yeah.

3166
03:43:49,021 --> 03:43:50,959
MATT: So he goes like--

3167
03:43:50,959 --> 03:43:56,620
LAURA: Hi, I'm not here.

3168
03:43:56,620 --> 03:43:58,076
MATT: "Okay."

3169
03:43:58,076 --> 03:44:04,537
LAURA: Okay. Sit down. Go to sleep, this is a
dream.

3170
03:44:04,537 --> 03:44:06,193
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3171
03:44:06,193 --> 03:44:12,086
TALIESIN: That's so good.

3172
03:44:12,086 --> 03:44:20,028
LAURA: That's so close. This is so bad. Five.

3173
03:44:20,028 --> 03:44:24,308
MATT: He doesn't seem to buy the dream thing, but
he's like--

3174
03:44:24,308 --> 03:44:27,730
LAURA: You want it to be a dream.

3175
03:44:27,730 --> 03:44:29,885
MATT: He doesn't go to sleep but he knows
you're there and he's keeping an eye, but

3176
03:44:29,885 --> 03:44:31,489
he's not doing anything.

3177
03:44:31,489 --> 03:44:36,477
LAURA: Okay, well it's good enough, I guess.

3178
03:44:36,477 --> 03:44:40,129
MATT: But he's definitely aware that you're
there.

3179
03:44:40,129 --> 03:44:45,105
LAURA: I'm going to go towards the big tent just
so I can see if I can sense any evil.

3180
03:44:45,105 --> 03:44:54,495
MATT: Okay. Really quickly, just to check because
it's-- That's right, Charm Person is not--

3181
03:44:54,495 --> 03:44:56,560
LAURA: It's not, yes.

3182
03:44:56,560 --> 03:45:04,547
MATT: Okay. It's at this point that you turn your
attention to the tent and focus. There is a hefty,

3183
03:45:04,547 --> 03:45:10,625
radiating warm fiendish source from the inside of
that large tent.

3184
03:45:10,625 --> 03:45:12,504
SAM: We found something!

3185
03:45:12,504 --> 03:45:17,852
LAURA: I can sense something. Let's go in the
tent.

3186
03:45:17,852 --> 03:45:20,402
SAM: Go in? But if it's bad, that's bad.

3187
03:45:20,402 --> 03:45:22,485
LAURA: What if it's just a dead thing?

3188
03:45:22,485 --> 03:45:29,924
SAM: Oh god, will we have to fight a dead thing?
Should we get some help? I turn to Caleb's cat and

3189
03:45:29,924 --> 03:45:38,250
I say go! Go get Caleb! Shoo! (hiss) Go away!
(hiss) I can't speak Cat! Go away!

3190
03:45:38,250 --> 03:45:41,502
MATT: The cat goes, (angry meow).

3191
03:45:41,502 --> 03:45:43,667
SAM: Go away! Go tell Caleb we're here!

3192
03:45:43,667 --> 03:45:45,230
MATT: (hiss)

3193
03:45:45,230 --> 03:45:48,653
LIAM: Yes!

3194
03:45:48,653 --> 03:45:53,514
MATT: Turns around and sprays you and then keep
walking.

3195
03:45:53,514 --> 03:45:54,681
SAM: Okay, I've sent for help.

3196
03:45:54,681 --> 03:45:58,728
LAURA: Okay. Let's go under the tent.

3197
03:45:58,728 --> 03:45:59,811
SAM: All right, let's go.

3198
03:45:59,811 --> 03:46:07,395
MATT: You guys carefully maneuver under the tent.
As soon as you curl into the interior of the tent

3199
03:46:07,395 --> 03:46:17,341
you hear a very heavy (snoring).

3200
03:46:17,341 --> 03:46:18,976
LAURA: This the big tent that you guys were just
in?

3201
03:46:18,976 --> 03:46:19,773
SAM: No.

3202
03:46:19,773 --> 03:46:21,131
MATT: No, it's the one on the south side of it.

3203
03:46:21,131 --> 03:46:22,543
SAM: It's a different one.

3204
03:46:22,543 --> 03:46:23,465
LAURA: Oh!

3205
03:46:23,465 --> 03:46:25,459
MARISHA: Toad guy.

3206
03:46:25,459 --> 03:46:32,869
MATT: You see the slowly expanding and contracting
form of Kylre from the back side. You see this

3207
03:46:32,869 --> 03:46:38,389
giant, scaly, somewhat oily exterior of the body.

3208
03:46:38,389 --> 03:46:41,112
SAM: That's why you detected him, because he's a
fiend.

3209
03:46:41,112 --> 03:46:43,509
LAURA: Maybe he's a good fiend, can fiends be
good?

3210
03:46:43,509 --> 03:46:47,647
SAM: I don't know, you detected--

3211
03:46:47,647 --> 03:46:49,427
LAURA: Is he still sleeping?

3212
03:46:49,427 --> 03:46:51,013
MATT: (snoring)

3213
03:46:51,013 --> 03:46:52,100
LAURA: He's still sleeping.

3214
03:46:52,100 --> 03:46:53,695
SAM: We can wake him up and ask?

3215
03:46:53,695 --> 03:46:55,325
LAURA: And ask if he's good or bad?

3216
03:46:55,325 --> 03:46:56,576
SAM: Yeah?

3217
03:46:56,576 --> 03:46:58,534
LAURA and SAM: Eh.

3218
03:46:58,534 --> 03:47:00,584
SAM: Is anyone else in the tent?

3219
03:47:00,584 --> 03:47:03,007
MATT: Make a perception check.

3220
03:47:03,007 --> 03:47:04,994
SAM: One.

3221
03:47:04,994 --> 03:47:09,814
LAURA: Oh no, we suck at this.

3222
03:47:09,814 --> 03:47:11,182
LIAM: This? Everything!

3223
03:47:11,182 --> 03:47:12,190
LAURA: 17.

3224
03:47:12,190 --> 03:47:17,237
MATT: Okay, that's better. You just stare right at
the body of this toad going, "Nope."

3225
03:47:17,237 --> 03:47:19,967
SAM: This looks really big and scary.

3226
03:47:19,967 --> 03:47:25,540
MATT: You glance and see a faint bit of a whitish
material from the crook of the arm. You take a few

3227
03:47:25,540 --> 03:47:32,870
steps forward and glance from the side and you can
see asleep, cradled in his large, lizardman arms,

3228
03:47:32,870 --> 03:47:38,148
Toya, dwarf girl is curled up and asleep
peacefully.

3229
03:47:38,148 --> 03:47:43,736
SAM: We should talk to her, but if we wake her up
he's going to be mad. I guess we have no choice,

3230
03:47:43,736 --> 03:47:49,781
we should talk to her. She's a dwarf? Do you speak
Dwarvish?

3231
03:47:49,781 --> 03:47:52,004
LAURA: No, I don't.

3232
03:47:52,004 --> 03:47:58,235
SAM: Maybe she speaks Common. We'll be fine. She's
a circus person.

3233
03:47:58,235 --> 03:48:02,367
LIAM: I have that ability, it lets you know
exactly where the fiend is. Which of those

3234
03:48:02,367 --> 03:48:04,036
things is the fiend?

3235
03:48:04,036 --> 03:48:06,521
LAURA: Which of the things is the fiend?

3236
03:48:06,521 --> 03:48:07,665
MATT: It's the large source.

3237
03:48:07,665 --> 03:48:09,218
LAURA: It's definitely the large fiend.

3238
03:48:09,218 --> 03:48:10,302
LIAM: It could have easily been the little girl.

3239
03:48:10,302 --> 03:48:12,064
MATT: It could have been, yeah.

3240
03:48:12,064 --> 03:48:13,314
LAURA: It's the big guy.

3241
03:48:13,314 --> 03:48:14,826
SAM: Let's wake her up!

3242
03:48:14,826 --> 03:48:18,050
MATT: The radiance is around the large creature.

3243
03:48:18,050 --> 03:48:19,157
LAURA: And her name is Toya?

3244
03:48:19,157 --> 03:48:20,855
SAM: Toya. Singing dwarf.

3245
03:48:20,855 --> 03:48:28,279
LAURA: Let's sit down on the ground and look
non-threatening. So we sit down cross-legged. Just

3246
03:48:28,279 --> 03:48:31,406
casual. Like we're having a tea party.

3247
03:48:31,406 --> 03:48:33,368
SAM: Put down my hair.

3248
03:48:33,368 --> 03:48:38,710
LAURA: And then we go: Toya! Toya wake up!

3249
03:48:38,710 --> 03:48:41,827
SAM: Wakey wakey!

3250
03:48:41,827 --> 03:48:45,655
MATT: The breathing stops and there's this
stillness in the interior of the tent.

3251
03:48:45,655 --> 03:48:50,537
SAM: We should light a light or something?
Otherwise we're just in the dark.

3252
03:48:50,537 --> 03:49:01,575
MATT: You hear this faint sound of squeaking as
lubricated folds of lizardman flesh twist over

3253
03:49:01,575 --> 03:49:07,745
each other as the devil toad's head kind of curls
back to look at you quietly, the mouth slightly

3254
03:49:07,745 --> 03:49:20,518
ajar. You can see rows of teeth and this bit of
drool down the edge of the chin onto the ground.

3255
03:49:20,518 --> 03:49:25,675
"What. you. want?"

3256
03:49:25,675 --> 03:49:28,556
LAURA: We're here to talk to Toya.

3257
03:49:28,556 --> 03:49:38,531
MATT: At which point the little girl (yawn) begins
(grunt) (thumping) and rotates in his space. He

3258
03:49:38,531 --> 03:49:43,689
takes up almost the entirety of this tent. And
slowly rotates around inside. Surprisingly quiet

3259
03:49:43,689 --> 03:49:54,873
for his size. And still clutching Toya, Toya sits
up and is like "What's happening? (yawn)"

3260
03:49:54,873 --> 03:49:55,653
LAURA: Hi!

3261
03:49:55,653 --> 03:49:56,817
MATT: "Hi!"

3262
03:49:56,817 --> 03:49:59,179
SAM: Sorry to disturb your slumber.

3263
03:49:59,179 --> 03:50:02,837
MATT: She takes her braids and holds them with her
hands, it's almost a safety blanket she curls into

3264
03:50:02,837 --> 03:50:11,514
herself. She looks about 11 or 12. This close you
can see she looks younger than she did from that

3265
03:50:11,514 --> 03:50:18,561
distance. Whether it be the presence or the mature
voice. But she seems pretty young. But she's not

3266
03:50:18,561 --> 03:50:19,679
childlike.

3267
03:50:19,679 --> 03:50:25,038
LAURA: Oh hey! What's going on.

3268
03:50:25,038 --> 03:50:27,391
MATT: " Well?"

3269
03:50:27,391 --> 03:50:31,156
SAM: Do you recognize us from the other night?
Last night?

3270
03:50:31,156 --> 03:50:32,406
LAURA: Last night.

3271
03:50:32,406 --> 03:50:33,711
SAM: Last night?

3272
03:50:33,711 --> 03:50:35,842
MATT: "I don't remember, I got scared."

3273
03:50:35,842 --> 03:50:39,299
LAURA: It was scary. You have a really pretty
voice.

3274
03:50:39,299 --> 03:50:42,111
MATT: "Thank you."

3275
03:50:42,111 --> 03:50:47,978
LAURA: Did you notice how when you sang that a
dude turned into a zombie?

3276
03:50:47,978 --> 03:50:57,689
MATT: She begins to chuckle. And the big toad
(laughter). "I did. It was really scary! I didn't

3277
03:50:57,689 --> 03:51:01,016
"like it at all. I didn't do that, did I?"

3278
03:51:01,016 --> 03:51:02,754
LAURA: Probably not.

3279
03:51:02,754 --> 03:51:05,131
SAM: Has it happened before, or was that--

3280
03:51:05,131 --> 03:51:09,463
MATT: "No. The guards are saying I probably did
that, they're saying I might have done that." It's

3281
03:51:09,463 --> 03:51:12,808
interesting, you notice now listening to her, she
has this beautiful voice but her speaking voice is

3282
03:51:12,808 --> 03:51:19,379
very crackly. It sounds almost damaged.

3283
03:51:19,379 --> 03:51:21,477
LAURA: Do you sing all the time, Toya?

3284
03:51:21,477 --> 03:51:27,539
MATT: "I sing a lot. It's what keeps me alive,
it's what gets me money."

3285
03:51:27,539 --> 03:51:29,570
LAURA: Right. I understand that.

3286
03:51:29,570 --> 03:51:31,959
SAM: Was that the same song you always sing?

3287
03:51:31,959 --> 03:51:35,190
MATT: "Yeah. It's the one song I know."

3288
03:51:35,190 --> 03:51:39,493
SAM: Did it feel the same coming out of you or was
it different?

3289
03:51:39,493 --> 03:51:40,851
MATT: "It felt the same."

3290
03:51:40,851 --> 03:51:44,252
LAURA: What language is it?

3291
03:51:44,252 --> 03:51:49,238
MATT: "It's an old dwarven tune. My mother taught
it to me before she passed."

3292
03:51:49,238 --> 03:51:51,825
LAURA: What does it mean?

3293
03:51:51,825 --> 03:52:01,683
MATT: "It's a tale of the angels and how they came
from the realms beyond of the gods. They granted

3294
03:52:01,683 --> 03:52:08,360
"each to us our sparks of life."

3295
03:52:08,360 --> 03:52:17,128
LAURA: Granted sparks of life. Does that sound
like a familiar story that I've heard before?

3296
03:52:17,128 --> 03:52:23,041
MATT: It sounds vaguely religious, but--

3297
03:52:23,041 --> 03:52:30,450
SAM: When you were singing, did you hear any other
sounds or words that someone else was saying?

3298
03:52:30,450 --> 03:52:38,668
MATT: "No, not beyond the ordinary. Then I saw
that poor man just start tearing through people. I

3299
03:52:38,668 --> 03:52:44,915
"got scared and Kylre helped me." She puts her arm
up and pats and (grunt).

3300
03:52:44,915 --> 03:52:48,019
LAURA: How did you and Kylre meet?

3301
03:52:48,019 --> 03:52:56,513
MATT: "They brought me into the circus. I was up
in a city north of here, far north of the Marrow

3302
03:52:56,513 --> 03:53:04,104
"Valley and I was just on the streets singing. And
this carnival came by and I met Gustav and he

3303
03:53:04,104 --> 03:53:12,045
"invited me to join and that's how I met Kylre and
I met all these wonderful people."

3304
03:53:12,045 --> 03:53:16,229
SAM: Has anyone new come around and talked to
you?

3305
03:53:16,229 --> 03:53:17,209
MATT: "No."

3306
03:53:17,209 --> 03:53:22,503
SAM: Asked you to do anything? It's so strange.

3307
03:53:22,503 --> 03:53:25,870
LAURA: Man, we suck at this.

3308
03:53:25,870 --> 03:53:29,712
SAM: No, we're really good.

3309
03:53:29,712 --> 03:53:35,471
MATT: "The newest people we've had are Mollymauk
and Yasha."

3310
03:53:35,471 --> 03:53:36,880
LAURA: They're new?

3311
03:53:36,880 --> 03:53:41,906
MATT: "Comparatively. Mollymauk's been here almost
two years now."

3312
03:53:41,906 --> 03:53:44,019
LAURA: Oh. Okay.

3313
03:53:44,019 --> 03:53:52,270
MATT: "He came after I did. We both found our
voice together. I was very scared and he wasn't

3314
03:53:52,270 --> 03:54:03,010
"talking and together we helped each other learn to
have fun again."

3315
03:54:03,010 --> 03:54:09,028
SAM: And yesterday before the show you didn't
notice anything weird, anyone creeping around the

3316
03:54:09,028 --> 03:54:11,720
carnival, setting up anything?

3317
03:54:11,720 --> 03:54:12,533
MATT: "No."

3318
03:54:12,533 --> 03:54:14,287
SAM: Snooping around?

3319
03:54:14,287 --> 03:54:16,353
LAURA: Anybody in weird cloaks?

3320
03:54:16,353 --> 03:54:18,177
SAM: Cloaks, cloaks!

3321
03:54:18,177 --> 03:54:21,040
MATT: "I didn't see anything."

3322
03:54:21,040 --> 03:54:22,675
LAURA: Okay.

3323
03:54:22,675 --> 03:54:27,451
LIAM: DM, on a minor note, I put my hand on
Fjord's shoulder and say I'm going to be blind for

3324
03:54:27,451 --> 03:54:34,877
a second, give me a little slap if anything goes
wrong. And I tune into Frumpkin who should still be--

3325
03:54:34,877 --> 03:54:45,022
MATT: At this point in time you notice (laughter)
Nott going "Shoo! Cah! Go find help!" and you hear

3326
03:54:45,022 --> 03:54:49,540
a (hiss) (grumpy meow). Yeah.

3327
03:54:49,540 --> 03:54:51,664
LIAM: And then Frumpkin takes off?

3328
03:54:51,664 --> 03:54:54,326
MATT: Frumpkin starts heading back around towards
you.

3329
03:54:54,326 --> 03:54:56,745
LIAM: So I'm looking at myself after a moment.

3330
03:54:56,745 --> 03:55:03,252
MATT: Briefly, as you keep concentrating, Frumpkin
finds his way under the tent and comes up to you.

3331
03:55:03,252 --> 03:55:09,504
SAM: Is there anyone you think would want to
destroy the carnival or hurt Gustav? Does Gustav

3332
03:55:09,504 --> 03:55:11,930
have any enemies?

3333
03:55:11,930 --> 03:55:15,867
MATT: "I hope not. I know him and Ornna argue a
lot, but--"

3334
03:55:15,867 --> 03:55:21,046
SAM: Him and Ornna? It's Ornna! Ornna's the one.
Thanks very much, we're out of here.

3335
03:55:21,046 --> 03:55:28,463
(laughter)

3336
03:55:28,463 --> 03:55:29,656
SAM: Hot lead!

3337
03:55:29,656 --> 03:55:32,326
LAURA: Let's go! We've got it, we've solved the
case!

3338
03:55:32,326 --> 03:55:36,037
TALIESIN: I'm going to have a tiny bit of
conversation with her.

3339
03:55:36,037 --> 03:55:39,915
MATT: Yeah. So while they're gone, the two of you
are in the other tent with the sisters and Ornna.

3340
03:55:39,915 --> 03:55:45,841
MARISHA: I would like to talk with the sisters
while that is going on.

3341
03:55:45,841 --> 03:55:49,051
MATT: They're both sitting there, knees tucked to
their chest.

3342
03:55:49,051 --> 03:56:02,038
MARISHA: I go and sit down next to them, putting
my knees up, too. This whole thing is really

3343
03:56:02,038 --> 03:56:03,818
messed up, right?

3344
03:56:03,818 --> 03:56:05,560
MATT: "Yeah, you're telling us."

3345
03:56:05,560 --> 03:56:14,596
MARISHA: Yeah. Man. Like, why would we do anything
like that? I feel like we're all being needlessly

3346
03:56:14,596 --> 03:56:17,228
persecuted.

3347
03:56:17,228 --> 03:56:19,174
MATT: "I'm sorry, who are you?"

3348
03:56:19,174 --> 03:56:30,438
MARISHA: Oh, sorry. I'm Beau. The other Bo, but I
helped fight the zombies the other night. I'm

3349
03:56:30,438 --> 03:56:34,274
under house arrest. We're under the same
situation, just separately. Not really. I don't

3350
03:56:34,274 --> 03:56:38,793
want to compare myself to you, because that would
be rude.

3351
03:56:38,793 --> 03:56:43,476
MATT: The two halfling twins look at each other,
and back at you.

3352
03:56:43,476 --> 03:56:51,407
TALIESIN: Her name's Beau. She's helping, she's
awful, you have a lot in common.

3353
03:56:51,407 --> 03:56:54,689
MATT: "Okay, well, I mean, whatever you want to
know."

3354
03:56:54,689 --> 03:56:58,273
MARISHA: He's such a dick. Why is he such a dick?

3355
03:56:58,273 --> 03:57:00,781
MATT: "Molly's great, why are you such a dick?"

3356
03:57:00,781 --> 03:57:02,949
TRAVIS: Reversal!

3357
03:57:02,949 --> 03:57:06,748
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, he's been talking shit about
you this whole time, I don't know, I just--

3358
03:57:06,748 --> 03:57:08,906
MATT: Make a deception check on that.

3359
03:57:08,906 --> 03:57:10,533
TRAVIS and LIAM: Oh.

3360
03:57:10,533 --> 03:57:12,867
LIAM: Stirring the pot.

3361
03:57:12,867 --> 03:57:17,047
MARISHA: It's okay. 15.

3362
03:57:17,047 --> 03:57:20,295
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk by the two twins,
because I'm circling the tent, trying to get a

3363
03:57:20,295 --> 03:57:23,915
look, and be like, I've absolutely been talking
shit. You're both terrible. I give them both a

3364
03:57:23,915 --> 03:57:26,218
kiss on the head and keep walking.

3365
03:57:26,218 --> 03:57:31,513
MATT: Okay. They both, "All right, so what are you
trying to do?"

3366
03:57:31,513 --> 03:57:37,355
MARISHA: What am I trying to do? I'm trying to
figure out who's behind all this so that we can

3367
03:57:37,355 --> 03:57:40,290
keep moving on with our lives.

3368
03:57:40,290 --> 03:57:44,884
MATT: "All right, well, get it over with. Soon as
this is done, we're out."

3369
03:57:44,884 --> 03:57:49,188
TALIESIN: They may not let us leave. They may be
killing us all.

3370
03:57:49,188 --> 03:57:52,658
MATT: "They're not going to kill us all!" The
other goes, "They're not going to kill us all."

3371
03:57:52,658 --> 03:57:56,228
TALIESIN: They're weird out there. They're very
weird out there.

3372
03:57:56,228 --> 03:57:58,290
MATT: (sighs)

3373
03:57:58,290 --> 03:58:02,122
MARISHA: Your guys' performance was amazing, by
the way.

3374
03:58:02,122 --> 03:58:04,216
MATT: "Thanks."

3375
03:58:04,216 --> 03:58:05,329
MARISHA: I loved it.

3376
03:58:05,329 --> 03:58:07,246
SAM: We're stealthing over to that tent, by the
way.

3377
03:58:07,246 --> 03:58:09,504
LAURA: I thought we were stealthing over to the
main tent.

3378
03:58:09,504 --> 03:58:11,396
SAM: The one with Ornna in it.

3379
03:58:11,396 --> 03:58:13,438
TALIESIN: Ornna's in the tent with us.

3380
03:58:13,438 --> 03:58:15,795
MATT: Oh, you guys are going to the main tent.

3381
03:58:15,795 --> 03:58:19,269
LAURA: I wanted to get to the main tent to see if
I could sense any evil in the big, main tent.

3382
03:58:19,269 --> 03:58:21,033
SAM: Oh, you want to swoop by the main tent?

3383
03:58:21,033 --> 03:58:22,787
LAURA: But if it's really far away.

3384
03:58:22,787 --> 03:58:25,129
MATT: Not too far away from where you were,
because you're backing out the side of it. So you

3385
03:58:25,129 --> 03:58:27,385
can go ahead and stealth around. Make a stealth
check.

3386
03:58:27,385 --> 03:58:30,001
LAURA: Oh, god. Please no one, please no whammies.

3387
03:58:30,001 --> 03:58:31,711
TALIESIN and LAURA: Big money.

3388
03:58:31,711 --> 03:58:32,942
SAM: I'm fine.

3389
03:58:32,942 --> 03:58:34,459
LAURA: Natural 20!

3390
03:58:34,459 --> 03:58:35,683
MATT: Nice, and what did you get?

3391
03:58:35,683 --> 03:58:36,729
SAM: 22.

3392
03:58:36,729 --> 03:58:42,212
MATT: The two of you, without issue, make your way
around towards the large tent without being seen.

3393
03:58:42,212 --> 03:58:43,835
SAM: Any evil?

3394
03:58:43,835 --> 03:58:44,879
LAURA: I'm sensing it.

3395
03:58:44,879 --> 03:58:45,726
MATT: Nothing.

3396
03:58:45,726 --> 03:58:46,602
SAM: Goddamn it.

3397
03:58:46,602 --> 03:58:47,513
LAURA: No fucking evil!

3398
03:58:47,513 --> 03:58:50,120
SAM: It's Ornna! We know who it is! We know who
the killer is!

3399
03:58:50,120 --> 03:58:53,730
TALIESIN: While you're talking to the twins, I'll
be talking to Ornna. Oh, for fuck's sake.

3400
03:58:53,730 --> 03:58:58,933
MATT: "To be honest, if it's any easier, it's
probably Gustav."

3401
03:58:58,933 --> 03:59:02,320
TALIESIN: It's not fucking Gustav.

3402
03:59:02,320 --> 03:59:07,449
MATT: "It probably is, you shut up. He's a prick,
he doesn't know what he's doing, he's going to run

3403
03:59:07,449 --> 03:59:12,255
this whole carnival into the ground. I don't want
to take the fall for it, we all get away on this.

3404
03:59:12,255 --> 03:59:14,566
MARISHA: No!

3405
03:59:14,566 --> 03:59:19,307
TRAVIS: Little feet.

3406
03:59:19,307 --> 03:59:25,926
LIAM: (snarling noises)

3407
03:59:25,926 --> 03:59:30,177
TRAVIS: Eats and shoots the same way. (snarls)

3408
03:59:30,177 --> 03:59:34,674
MARISHA: So wait, it's probably Gustav? What makes
you say that?

3409
03:59:34,674 --> 03:59:37,602
MATT: "Because he's in prison, he's the leader,
he's fucked this whole thing by letting this

3410
03:59:37,602 --> 03:59:39,272
happen."

3411
03:59:39,272 --> 03:59:44,227
MARISHA: Oh. Wow. You have interesting
perspectives. Hey, weird question, how do you guys

3412
03:59:44,227 --> 03:59:55,197
come up with your acts? Is that something that you
guys create yourselves, or do you guys workshop it?

3413
03:59:55,197 --> 03:59:57,650
TALIESIN: It's like she's never experienced
boredom. It's very weird.

3414
03:59:57,650 --> 03:59:59,641
MATT: "Yeah. It's impressive."

3415
03:59:59,641 --> 04:00:01,079
TALIESIN: Hey, Ornna?

3416
04:00:01,079 --> 04:00:03,674
MATT: Ornna goes, "Yes?"

3417
04:00:03,674 --> 04:00:09,449
TALIESIN: (sighs) I mean, I know your feelings on
all this. What do you think?

3418
04:00:09,449 --> 04:00:20,566
MATT: (sighs) "I'd say Bosun's a stand up guy, if
a bit of a self-absorbed dick at times. And we all

3419
04:00:20,566 --> 04:00:25,020
"knew Gustav was going to shit the bed sooner or
later, I mean, this is his karma. I just don't

3420
04:00:25,020 --> 04:00:29,666
"know how, or why, but I can guarantee you, if this
was my carnival, this shit wouldn't have happened.

3421
04:00:29,666 --> 04:00:31,156
TALIESIN: Really?

3422
04:00:31,156 --> 04:00:32,176
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

3423
04:00:32,176 --> 04:00:35,024
TALIESIN: What exactly would you have done?

3424
04:00:35,024 --> 04:00:40,649
MATT: "Well, first off, I would have made sure
that we had better support from the guard before

3425
04:00:40,649 --> 04:00:43,584
this all happened so nobody else got killed."

3426
04:00:43,584 --> 04:00:46,176
TALIESIN: They were useless.

3427
04:00:46,176 --> 04:00:54,161
MATT: "Secondly, I would have made sure that there
weren't any old folks that made it in to fucking

3428
04:00:54,161 --> 04:00:56,640
turn into shit."

3429
04:00:56,640 --> 04:01:04,220
TALIESIN: Well, that's on me and-- That's on me.

3430
04:01:04,220 --> 04:01:06,684
MATT: "I don't know."

3431
04:01:06,684 --> 04:01:11,376
MARISHA: You feel the same way, Knot sisters? Feel
like this is karma on Gustav?

3432
04:01:11,376 --> 04:01:13,298
TALIESIN: They would.

3433
04:01:13,298 --> 04:01:17,736
MATT: At which point, the flap of the tent opens
up and it's Jester.

3434
04:01:17,736 --> 04:01:19,112
LAURA: It's Ornna!

3435
04:01:19,112 --> 04:01:20,614
SAM: Ornna, you have a lot of explaining to do!

3436
04:01:20,614 --> 04:01:21,789
MARISHA: Shut up!

3437
04:01:21,789 --> 04:01:22,789
SAM: You have a lot of explaining to do!

3438
04:01:22,789 --> 04:01:24,962
MARISHA: Shut up!

3439
04:01:24,962 --> 04:01:28,007
SAM: We've talked to Toya. She knows it's you who
did this!

3440
04:01:28,007 --> 04:01:30,504
LAURA: We know you guys are in a fight all the
time.

3441
04:01:30,504 --> 04:01:32,854
SAM: You're the one behind the whole plot! You did
it!

3442
04:01:32,854 --> 04:01:34,183
LAURA: You!

3443
04:01:34,183 --> 04:01:41,896
MATT: The two Knot sisters immediately go, "Ornna?
Is it you? Did you kill that guy?" Ornna's like,

3444
04:01:41,896 --> 04:01:46,858
"I don't know what you're talking about. What the
fuck is this? Who the fuck are you!"

3445
04:01:46,858 --> 04:01:49,334
LAURA: Why did you turn that guy into a zombie?

3446
04:01:49,334 --> 04:01:50,924
SAM: Who do you work for!

3447
04:01:50,924 --> 04:01:51,966
TALIESIN: Ornna, Ornna.

3448
04:01:51,966 --> 04:01:53,844
MARISHA: Insight check on the Knot sisters!

3449
04:01:53,844 --> 04:01:56,052
MATT: Go for it.

3450
04:01:56,052 --> 04:01:58,085
SAM: They've got Nazi in their name!

3451
04:01:58,085 --> 04:02:00,647
MARISHA: What?!

3452
04:02:00,647 --> 04:02:03,847
SAM: Knot &lt;i>see&lt;/i>sters.

3453
04:02:03,847 --> 04:02:05,414
MARISHA: Natural 20!

3454
04:02:05,414 --> 04:02:08,334
[all exclaiming]

3455
04:02:08,334 --> 04:02:10,683
LIAM: Whispers!

3456
04:02:10,683 --> 04:02:12,701
LAURA: The first whisper!

3457
04:02:12,701 --> 04:02:15,193
MARISHA: Give me that sweet whisper!

3458
04:02:15,193 --> 04:02:21,453
SAM: Guys, I don't know about you. But my stats
are so neat because of D&D Beyond tonight.

3459
04:02:21,453 --> 04:02:23,251
LIAM: There's no pencil smudges.

3460
04:02:23,251 --> 04:02:26,497
SAM: No, I know right now I've got 14 of 15 hit
points.

3461
04:02:26,497 --> 04:02:30,438
TRAVIS: It opens, it closes, you can see your
spells when you need to see them without

3462
04:02:30,438 --> 04:02:31,390
flipping.

3463
04:02:31,390 --> 04:02:34,825
TALIESIN: I've got a little iPad button on the
back of my pen, it's quite nice.

3464
04:02:34,825 --> 04:02:41,420
SAM: Start talking, or this gnome-- nope! Goblin!
Starts biting.

3465
04:02:41,420 --> 04:02:46,128
MATT: Ornna goes, "To be perfectly honest, I have
no idea what's going on. Y'all just came in here,

3466
04:02:46,128 --> 04:02:50,375
started throwing accusations at me. Gustav got
arrested. Bosun got arrested. &lt;i>Molly&lt;/i> got

3467
04:02:50,375 --> 04:02:58,308
arrested, I'm glad you got off that. But to be
perfectly honest, this whole thing's a shit show.

3468
04:02:58,308 --> 04:03:01,202
And the circus is probably not going to be the
same after this."

3469
04:03:01,202 --> 04:03:02,707
LAURA: Insight check on the--

3470
04:03:02,707 --> 04:03:04,810
MATT: Insight check on Ornna.

3471
04:03:04,810 --> 04:03:08,386
LIAM: My cat is on patrol because we've been
standing with our dicks in our hands for a long

3472
04:03:08,386 --> 04:03:09,540
time.

3473
04:03:09,540 --> 04:03:11,004
MATT: Yeah, I'm sorry.

3474
04:03:11,004 --> 04:03:14,084
LIAM: No! I'm not complaining, but I would have
sent the cat out.

3475
04:03:14,084 --> 04:03:15,671
LAURA: Seven.

3476
04:03:15,671 --> 04:03:20,700
MATT: Kind of hard to read. She seems genuinely
frustrated and caught off guard by this.

3477
04:03:20,700 --> 04:03:22,290
LAURA: I think she's telling the truth.

3478
04:03:22,290 --> 04:03:25,558
TALIESIN: Ornna, you might as well come clean,
this is classic you.

3479
04:03:25,558 --> 04:03:30,710
MATT: She looks at you. "Molly."

3480
04:03:30,710 --> 04:03:31,586
TALIESIN: I'm just trying to--

3481
04:03:31,586 --> 04:03:32,925
MATT: "Fuck you."

3482
04:03:32,925 --> 04:03:40,453
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck you, too. It's no secret that
Ornna and Gustav have their differences, but this

3483
04:03:40,453 --> 04:03:46,137
ridiculous. I mean, she knows damn well that half
the circus would leave if he got fucking arrested

3484
04:03:46,137 --> 04:03:48,037
and died.

3485
04:03:48,037 --> 04:03:55,619
MATT: "You're for real worried about this? You
really think who it could be? Let's play. Gustav:

3486
04:03:55,619 --> 04:04:04,069
he's an idiot. But he's not a murderer. Bosun: bit
of a dick. But he's a stand up fella. Toya:

3487
04:04:04,069 --> 04:04:14,375
absolute doll. Couldn't hurt a fly. Mona and Yuli:
They're cunts. But they're not going to kill

3488
04:04:14,375 --> 04:04:23,943
anyone. Desmond's a weird fellow. There's
something dark in his past; you can see it in his

3489
04:04:23,943 --> 04:04:26,639
melancholy.

3490
04:04:26,639 --> 04:04:28,263
TALIESIN: But this is not his style.

3491
04:04:28,263 --> 04:04:30,040
SAM: It's Desmond. Let's go to his tent!

3492
04:04:30,040 --> 04:04:33,421
TALIESIN: I just grab--

3493
04:04:33,421 --> 04:04:43,058
MATT: "There's some untrustworthy intelligence in
those lizard eyes of that devil."

3494
04:04:43,058 --> 04:04:45,897
LAURA: I did get a very evil kind of vibe off
him.

3495
04:04:45,897 --> 04:04:47,503
TALIESIN: What do you mean evil kind of vibe?

3496
04:04:47,503 --> 04:04:49,640
LAURA: Well, I mean, he's a fiend.

3497
04:04:49,640 --> 04:04:52,407
TALIESIN: He's what?

3498
04:04:52,407 --> 04:04:56,411
LAURA: The devil toad guy. He's a fiend.

3499
04:04:56,411 --> 04:05:02,623
TALIESIN: That's just a name. It's not actually,
like real thing. That just--

3500
04:05:02,623 --> 04:05:05,623
[stammering]

3501
04:05:05,623 --> 04:05:09,699
LAURA: You guys know he's a fiend, right?

3502
04:05:09,699 --> 04:05:14,323
MATT: There's this moment of silence, like, "He's
supposed to be lizardfolk."

3503
04:05:14,323 --> 04:05:16,944
TALIESIN: What do you--

3504
04:05:16,944 --> 04:05:19,130
SAM: It's the lizard man!

3505
04:05:19,130 --> 04:05:28,691
TALIESIN: I grab and push you down into the ground
and hold you. (shushing sounds) Not yet.

3506
04:05:28,691 --> 04:05:30,631
SAM: We're cracking this case wide open.

3507
04:05:30,631 --> 04:05:33,073
MATT: You guys, what are you doing?

3508
04:05:33,073 --> 04:05:37,822
LIAM: I mean, just because we're standing here so
long, I would have been nervous and again held on

3509
04:05:37,822 --> 04:05:40,449
to this guy's big bicep and sent the cat out.

3510
04:05:40,449 --> 04:05:44,193
TRAVIS: Why are you going all catatonic on me?

3511
04:05:44,193 --> 04:05:53,908
MATT: (laughs) Nice. As the cat darts under the
tent and makes its way through, you glance over to

3512
04:05:53,908 --> 04:06:04,269
the fire and sees a large dark shape step out from
one of the tents and you watch as one of the

3513
04:06:04,269 --> 04:06:13,378
guards who's sitting in the chair stands up and
crumples onto the ground without a sound. You see

3514
04:06:13,378 --> 04:06:22,745
the other guard look over, go over and run up to him
and start to check on him. You guys hear a voice

3515
04:06:22,745 --> 04:06:27,703
in the back start saying, "Damon? Damon?"

3516
04:06:27,703 --> 04:06:30,865
MARISHA: Just a guard. One of the guards.

3517
04:06:30,865 --> 04:06:33,588
LIAM: Fjord, something bad is happening.

3518
04:06:33,588 --> 04:06:41,120
MATT: You watch as the dark figure spins and two
flashes of red in the shadow nearby and you watch

3519
04:06:41,120 --> 04:06:47,073
as the other guard suddenly grabs his head and
grasps at his chest and falls on his back as his

3520
04:06:47,073 --> 04:06:48,614
legs curl up.

3521
04:06:48,614 --> 04:06:50,191
MARISHA: What the fuck!

3522
04:06:50,191 --> 04:06:52,570
LIAM: Do I know where in relation to Fjord and I
this is?

3523
04:06:52,570 --> 04:06:54,914
MATT: It is to the east of you, about 150 feet.

3524
04:06:54,914 --> 04:06:57,016
TRAVIS: Can you talk to me when you're looking
through the cat?

3525
04:06:57,016 --> 04:07:00,145
LIAM: I can talk, but I can't hear anything when
I'm doing this.

3526
04:07:00,145 --> 04:07:05,494
MATT: Correct. You watch as the shadow bounds like
a giant frog--

3527
04:07:05,494 --> 04:07:07,914
LIAM: The frog is on the move. Frog is on the
move.

3528
04:07:07,914 --> 04:07:09,231
MATT: --northward.

3529
04:07:09,231 --> 04:07:16,635
LIAM: Away from us? But I don't know where the
others are.

3530
04:07:16,635 --> 04:07:20,611
MATT: You guys hear the name calling, and then
silence once more.

3531
04:07:20,611 --> 04:07:23,370
LAURA: (whispers) Can we peek outside of the tent
and see what's going on?

3532
04:07:23,370 --> 04:07:31,930
MATT: You guys go ahead and you look just as the
guard on the ground is like (gurgling) and just

3533
04:07:31,930 --> 04:07:35,475
stops moving. You see all the veins bulging.

3534
04:07:35,475 --> 04:07:39,628
MARISHA: I run up to the guard and check his
pulse. Is he still alive or is he paralyzed?

3535
04:07:39,628 --> 04:07:47,106
MATT: As you come out of the tent, you watch as
the flesh on his neck and throat splits and a very

3536
04:07:47,106 --> 04:07:52,179
familiar transformation begins to take place as
both of the guards begin to (growling).

3537
04:07:52,179 --> 04:07:54,860
LAURA: Oh no. We have to fight them.

3538
04:07:54,860 --> 04:07:57,685
MARISHA: Yeah, but get under the tent! We can get
the drop!

3539
04:07:57,685 --> 04:08:06,140
LIAM: I come out of it and I-- Zombies. I start
running towards the tent that I saw Jester peek

3540
04:08:06,140 --> 04:08:07,334
out from under.

3541
04:08:07,334 --> 04:08:14,511
MATT: As you guys rush underneath the big blue
tent, you watch as the two guards that are quickly

3542
04:08:14,511 --> 04:08:18,781
bulging and mutating, bits of their flesh
dislodging from their body and falling. You watch

3543
04:08:18,781 --> 04:08:24,161
now, up close, similar to the last time, but now
that you are looking intently for this, you can

3544
04:08:24,161 --> 04:08:31,566
see where there should be blood, it's almost like
dust and sand begin to spill from the wounds.

3545
04:08:31,566 --> 04:08:35,189
Something you had noticed a little bit in the body
of the old man before, but you didn't know if it

3546
04:08:35,189 --> 04:08:37,941
was decomposition or just general dirt.

3547
04:08:37,941 --> 04:08:41,083
TALIESIN: Girls, we're not supposed to be here.
Can you help us handle this?

3548
04:08:41,083 --> 04:08:46,635
MATT: You watch as the two halflings are like,
"Fuck no!"

3549
04:08:46,635 --> 04:08:52,109
TALIESIN: (sighs) We'll do what we can. If
something goes wrong, nudity usually works.

3550
04:08:52,109 --> 04:08:57,299
[laughing]

3551
04:08:57,299 --> 04:09:03,782
MATT: The two mutated guards now, their armor
bulging and broken in places, turn to the noises

3552
04:09:03,782 --> 04:09:05,712
in the tent where you guys are.

3553
04:09:05,712 --> 04:09:08,211
SAM: Are we in the same tent or are we in two
different tents?

3554
04:09:08,211 --> 04:09:11,718
MATT: You guys are all in one tent with the other
girls. You are all jammed into the space. The two

3555
04:09:11,718 --> 04:09:17,510
of you make your way outside of the large tent as
you watch these two bulging, zombified creatures

3556
04:09:17,510 --> 04:09:21,387
making their way towards the tent. And that's
where we're going to pick up next time.

3557
04:09:21,387 --> 04:09:23,496
(groaning)

3558
04:09:23,496 --> 04:09:24,882
SAM: Bastard!

3559
04:09:24,882 --> 04:09:26,869
MATT: Because it is 11 now.

3560
04:09:26,869 --> 04:09:30,648
TRAVIS: But we're not supposed to be there! We're
gonna get framed for it!

3561
04:09:30,648 --> 04:09:33,001
MARISHA: Exactly, we can't get framed!

3562
04:09:33,001 --> 04:09:38,032
SAM: Can I just say, Laura and I busted the case
&lt;i>wide open&lt;/i>!

3563
04:09:38,032 --> 04:09:40,344
(laughter)

3564
04:09:40,344 --> 04:09:42,248
TRAVIS: That is true!

3565
04:09:42,248 --> 04:09:48,560
SAM: We solved the case. Easy.

3566
04:09:48,560 --> 04:09:49,950
LAURA: Totally.

3567
04:09:49,950 --> 04:09:53,111
TALIESIN: Which one's Nancy, which one's Drew?

3568
04:09:53,111 --> 04:09:55,092
SAM: Couple inquisitions. Couple little, uh--

3569
04:09:55,092 --> 04:09:56,995
Following the clues.

3570
04:09:56,995 --> 04:09:58,103
LAURA: That's right.

3571
04:09:58,103 --> 04:10:00,263
TALIESIN: Just one more question.

3572
04:10:00,263 --> 04:10:06,032
TRAVIS: When that demon frog leapt, how high and
how far, approximately, did it look like it went?

3573
04:10:06,032 --> 04:10:11,956
MATT: It looks like it leapt about 20 to 25 feet
in the air and traveled about 40 feet with the

3574
04:10:11,956 --> 04:10:13,640
leap. It was a large arc.

3575
04:10:13,640 --> 04:10:15,775
LAURA: So we definitely can't fight that thing.

3576
04:10:15,775 --> 04:10:16,701
TRAVIS: Sure we can.

3577
04:10:16,701 --> 04:10:17,832
LAURA: Oh my god.

3578
04:10:17,832 --> 04:10:20,087
TRAVIS: Oh god.

3579
04:10:20,087 --> 04:10:22,548
MATT: You saw it escape northward from where you
are.

3580
04:10:22,548 --> 04:10:24,893
MARISHA: And did it look like the same figure?

3581
04:10:24,893 --> 04:10:33,262
MATT: Yasha ran north, northeast. This is just
straight north of where you are.

3582
04:10:33,262 --> 04:10:35,568
Towards the Ustaloch.

3583
04:10:35,568 --> 04:10:40,286
MARISHA: Towards Ustaloch! It's the fucking lake!

3584
04:10:40,286 --> 04:10:42,636
[crosstalk]

3585
04:10:42,636 --> 04:10:45,323
TRAVIS: Oh man, this is good, dude!

3586
04:10:45,323 --> 04:10:54,959
MARISHA: See, here's my thing. Does anyone else
notice that the zombie transformations seem like a

3587
04:10:54,959 --> 04:11:01,656
serpent shedding its skin? Because they always
slough off their skin?

3588
04:11:01,656 --> 04:11:05,031
TRAVIS: It's also done without any contact.

3589
04:11:05,031 --> 04:11:06,101
MARISHA: Wait, what?

3590
04:11:06,101 --> 04:11:08,344
TRAVIS: It's done without any contact. He never
touches him.

3591
04:11:08,344 --> 04:11:09,807
LAURA: Yeah, he touched him, didn't he?

3592
04:11:09,807 --> 04:11:11,022
MATT: No.

3593
04:11:11,022 --> 04:11:12,522
LAURA: I thought he did.

3594
04:11:12,522 --> 04:11:15,322
MATT: No, they just suddenly began to erupt in--

3595
04:11:15,322 --> 04:11:22,094
LAURA: Hey, bonus news, though. The charm spell
guy isn't going to turn me dead!

3596
04:11:22,094 --> 04:11:25,130
MATT: Look at that silver lining!

3597
04:11:25,130 --> 04:11:28,600
TALIESIN: This season got dark. Season got dark.

3598
04:11:28,600 --> 04:11:31,347
LAURA: Whoa. Tight tight tight tight.

3599
04:11:31,347 --> 04:11:34,950
TRAVIS: Good shit. Little damaged voice, fuck
yeah.

3600
04:11:34,950 --> 04:11:36,367
MATT: That'll be fun.

3601
04:11:36,367 --> 04:11:39,824
LAURA: I wanted to cough for her.

3602
04:11:39,824 --> 04:11:45,730
MATT: We'll pick up there next week. The chase is
on, apparently. Thank you guys so much for being

3603
04:11:45,730 --> 04:11:49,504
awesome. Thank you guys for coming along and
watching with us. We'll pick this up next Thursday

3604
04:11:49,504 --> 04:11:55,934
where we left off, right in the middle of this
campsite. Until then, have a wonderful week. See

3605
04:11:55,934 --> 04:11:59,264
you guys then. And, is it Thursday yet?

3606
04:11:59,264 --> 04:12:01,307
Goodnight.

3607
04:12:01,307 --> 04:12:08,620
